# example-app-router-migration

An example that showcases a basic installation of `next-intl` in a Next.js app that uses both the Pages as well as the App Router.

**Important**: Do not add an `i18n` config to `next.config.js`, as it will cause the `app` directory to be ignored.

You can run the example locally like this:

```
yarn
yarn dev
```
