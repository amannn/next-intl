# example-app-router-without-i18n-routing

An example that showcases how an app can provide a locale in `i18n.ts` to `next-intl` in an App Router setup.

**Note that:**

1. No `[locale]` segment needs to be added
2. No routing APIs need to be used (middleware and navigation APIs)
3. Eligibility for static or dynamic rendering is decided by user
