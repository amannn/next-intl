# example-app-router-without-i18n-routing

An example that showcases how an app can provide a locale in `i18n.ts` to `next-intl` in an App Router setup.

This can be useful in the following cases:

1. You'd like to provide a locale to `next-intl`, e.g. based on user settings
2. Your app only supports a single language

**Note that:**

1. No `[locale]` segment needs to be added
2. No routing APIs need to be used (middleware and navigation APIs)
3. Eligibility for static or dynamic rendering is decided by user

## Deploy your own

By deploying to [Vercel](https://vercel.com), you can check out the example in action. Note that you'll be prompted to create a new GitHub repository as part of this, allowing you to make subsequent changes.
