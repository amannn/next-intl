# example-app-router-without-routing

An example that showcases how an app can provide a locale in `i18n.ts` to `next-intl` in an App Router setup. This can be used for single-language setups and apps where the locale is read from the user settings instead of the pathname.

**Note that:**

1. No `[locale]` segment needs to be added
2. No middleware needs to be configured
3. The navigation APIs from `next-intl` don't need to be used
