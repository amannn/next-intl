# example-app-router-mixed-routing

An example of how to achieve locale prefixes on public routes while reading the locale from user settings on pages for logged-in users.

**Relevant docs:**
1. [Setting up `next-intl` with i18n routing](https://next-intl-docs.vercel.app/docs/getting-started/app-router/with-i18n-routing)
2. [Setting up `next-intl` without i18n routing](https://next-intl-docs.vercel.app/docs/getting-started/app-router/without-i18n-routing)

**Relevant parts in app code:**
1. `src/middleware.ts`: Only run middleware on public pages that need to be localized.
2. `src/i18n/request.ts`: Use the locale from the pathname segment for public routes or return a locale from the user profile for internal app routes.
3. `src/navigation.public.ts`: These are the navigation APIs that automatically consider the `[locale]` segment for public routes. For internal app routes, the navigation APIs from Next.js should be used directly (see `PublicNavigation.tsx` vs `AppNavigation.tsx`).

Note that while this approach works fine, you can alternatively also consider a monorepo setup and build the public and internal app separately if you'd like to separate the code for the two apps.

## Deploy your own
