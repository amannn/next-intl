# Agents

- When creating a PR, use conventional commit prefixes for the PR title.
- Make sure ESLint and Prettier pass on changed files before committing.
- Make sure all tests pass before committing, unless specifically stated otherwise.
- If running a test with vitest, use "run" to avoid being stuck in watch mode.
