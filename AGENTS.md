## Always

- If running a test with vitest, use "run" to avoid being stuck in watch mode.

## When committing

- Make sure ESLint and Prettier pass on changed files.
- Make sure all tests pass.

## When creating a PR

- When creating a PR, use conventional commit prefixes for the PR title (e.g. `fix: `, `feat: `, ...).
