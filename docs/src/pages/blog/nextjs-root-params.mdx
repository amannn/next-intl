# New in Next.js 15.X: `rootParams`

<small>Dec XX, 2024 · by Jan Amann</small>

(this post is still a draft)

Next.js v15.X was just released and comes with a new feature: [`rootParams`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/72837).

This new API fills in the [missing piece](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/58862) that allows apps that use top-level dynamic segments like `[locale]` to read segment values deeply in Server Components:

```tsx
import {unstable_rootParams as rootParams} from 'next/server';

async function Component() {
  // The ability to read params deeply in
  // Server Components ... finally!
  const {locale} = await rootParams();
}
```

This addition is a game-changer for `next-intl`.

While the library previously relied on workarounds to provide a locale to Server Components, this API now provides native support in Next.js for this use case, allowing the library to integrate much tighter with Next.js.

Practically, for users of `next-intl` this means:

1. Being able to support static rendering of apps with i18n routing without `setRequestLocale`
2. Improved integration with Next.js cache mechanisms
3. Preparation for upcoming rendering modes in Next.js like [Partial Prerendering](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/ppr) and [`dynamicIO`](https://nextjs.org/docs/canary/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/dynamicIO) (although there seems to be more work necessary here on the Next.js side)

But first, let's have a look at how this API works in practice.

## Root layouts

Previously, Next.js required a [root layout](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/layout#root-layouts) to be present at `app/layout.tsx`—the root of your app.

Now, you can move a root layout to a nested segment, which can also be dynamic:

```
src
└── app
    └── [locale]
        ├── layout.tsx (root layout)
        └── page.tsx
```

In this extended definition, a root layout now is any layout that has no other layouts located above it.

In contrast, layouts that do have other layout ancestors are regular layouts:

```
src
└── app
    └── [locale]
        ├── layout.tsx (root layout)
        ├── (...)
        └── news
            ├── layout.tsx (regular layout)
            └── page.tsx
```

With the addition of `rootParams`, you can now read param values of a root layout in all Server Components that render within it:

```tsx filename=src/components/LocaleSwitcher.tsx
import {unstable_rootParams as rootParams} from 'next/server';

export async function LocaleSwitcher() {
  // Read the value of `[locale]`
  const {locale} = await rootParams();

  // ...
}
```

## Multiple root layouts

Here's where it gets interesting: With [route groups](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-groups), you can provide another layout for pages that are not located in the `[locale]` segment:

```
src
└── app
    ├── [locale]
    │   ├── layout.tsx
    │   └── page.tsx
    └── (unlocalized)
        ├── layout.tsx
        └── page.tsx
```

The layout at `[locale]/layout.tsx` as well as the layout at `(unlocalized)/layout.tsx` both have no other layouts located above them, therefore both qualify as root layouts.

Due to this, in this case the returned value of `rootParams` will depend on where the component that calls the function is being rendered from.

If you call `rootParams` in shared code that is used by both root layouts, this allows for a pattern like this:

```tsx filename="src/utils/getLocale.tsx"
import {unstable_rootParams as rootParams} from 'next/server';

export default async function getLocale() {
  // Try to read the locale in case we're in `[locale]/layout.tsx`
  let {locale} = await rootParams();

  // If we're in `(unlocalized)/layout.tsx`, let's use a fallback
  if (!locale) {
    locale = 'en';
  }

  return locale;
}
```

With this, you can use the `getLocale` function across your codebase to read the current locale without having to worry about where it's being called from.

In an internationalized app, this can for example be useful to implement a country selection page at the root where you have to rely on a default locale. Once the user is within the `[locale]` segment, this param value can be used instead for localizing page content.

## Static rendering

In case we know all possible values for the `[locale]` segment ahead of time, we can provide them to Next.js using the [`generateStaticParams`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-static-params) function to enable static rendering:

```tsx filename="src/app/[locale]/layout.tsx"
const locales = ['en', 'de'];

// Pre-render all available locales at build time
export async function generateStaticParams() {
  return locales.map((locale) => ({locale}));
}

// ...
```

In combination with [`dynamicParams`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/route-segment-config#dynamicparams), we can furthermore instruct Next.js to disallow values that are encountered at runtime and do not match the values we've provided to `generateStaticParams`:

```tsx filename="src/app/[locale]/layout.tsx"
// Return a 404 for any unknown locales
export const dynamicParams = false;

// ...
```

## Leveraging `rootParams` in `next-intl`

So, how can you use this feature in `next-intl`?

Similarly to how we've defined the `getLocale` function above, we do in fact already have a shared place that is called by all server-side functions that require the current locale of the user: [`i18n/request.ts`](/docs/usage/configuration#server-client-components).

So let's use `rootParams` here:

```tsx filename="src/i18n/request.ts" {7}
import {unstable_rootParams as rootParams} from 'next/server';
import {getRequestConfig} from 'next-intl/server';
import {hasLocale} from 'next-intl';
import {routing} from './routing';

export default getRequestConfig(async () => {
  const params = await rootParams();
  const locale = hasLocale(routing.locales, params.locale)
    ? params.locale
    : routing.defaultLocale;

  return {
    locale,
    messages: (await import(`../../messages/${locale}.json`)).default
  };
});
```

`hasLocale` is a new addition scheduled for [`next-intl@4.0`](/blog/next-intl-4-0), but practically simply checks if the provided `locales` array contains a given `locale`. If it doesn't, typically because we're not in the `[locale]` segment, a default locale is used instead.

That's it—a single change to `i18n/request.ts` is all you need to do to start using `rootParams`!

## Time for spring cleaning

With this change, you can now simplify your codebase in various ways:

### Removing a pass-through root layout

For certain patterns like global 404 pages, you might have used a pass-through root layout so far:

```tsx filename="src/app/layout.tsx"
type Props = {
  children: React.ReactNode;
};

export default function RootLayout({children}: Props) {
  return children;
}
```

This needs to be removed now as otherwise this will qualify as a root layout instead of the one defined at `src/app/[locale]/layout.tsx`.

### Avoid reading the `[locale]` segment

Since `next-intl` provides the current locale via [`useLocale` and `getLocale`](/docs/usage/configuration#locale), you can seamlessly read the locale from these APIs instead of `params` now:

```diff filename="src/app/[locale]/layout.tsx"
+ import {getLocale} from 'next-intl/server';

type Props = {
  children: React.ReactNode;
-  params: {locale: string};
};

export default async function RootLayout({
  children,
-  params
}: Props) {
-  const {locale} = await params;
+  const locale = await getLocale();

  return (
    <html lang={locale}>
      <body>{children}</body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

Behind the scenes, if you call `useLocale` or `getLocale` in a Server Component, your `i18n/request.ts` config will be consulted, potentially using a fallback that you have defined.

### Remove manual locale overrides [#locale-override]

If you're using async APIs like `getTranslations`, you might have previously passed the locale manually, typically to enable static rendering in the Metadata API.

Now, you can remove this and rely on the locale that is returned from `i18n/request.ts`:

```diff filename="src/app/[locale]/page.tsx"
- type Props = {
-   params: Promise<{locale: string}>;
- };

export async function generateMetadata(
-  {params}: Props
) {
-  const {locale} = await params;
-  const t = await getTranslations({locale, namespace: 'HomePage'});
+  const t = await getTranslations('HomePage');

  // ...
}
```

The only rare case where you might still want to pass a locale to `getTranslations` is if your UI renders messages from multiple locales in parallel:

```tsx
// Use messages from the current locale
const t = getTranslations();

// Use messages from 'en', regardless of what the current user locale is
const t = getTranslations({locale: 'en'});
```

In this case, you should make sure to accept an override in your `i18n/request.ts` config:

```tsx filename="src/i18n/request.ts"
import {unstable_rootParams as rootParams} from 'next/server';
import {getRequestConfig} from 'next-intl/server';
import {hasLocale} from 'next-intl';
import {routing} from './routing';

export default getRequestConfig(async ({locale}) => {
  // Use a locale based on these priorities:
  // 1. An override passed to the function
  // 2. A locale from the `[locale]` segment
  // 3. A default locale
  if (!locale) {
    const params = await rootParams();
    locale = hasLocale(routing.locales, params.locale)
      ? params.locale
      : routing.defaultLocale;
  }

  return {
    locale
    // ...
  };
});
```

This is a very rare case, so if you're unsure, you very likely don't need this.

### Static rendering

If you've previously used `setRequestLocale` to enable static rendering, you can now remove it:

```diff filename="src/[locale]/page.tsx"
- import {setRequestLocale} from 'next-intl/server';

- type Props = {
-   params: Promise<{locale: string}>;
- }

- export default function Page({params}: Props) {
-   setRequestLocale(params.locale);
+ export default function Page() {
  // ...
}
```

Note that `generateStaticParams` is naturally still required though.

### Handling unknown locales

Not strictly a new feature of Next.js, but in case you're using `generateStaticParams`, the easiest way to ensure that only the locales you've defined are allowed is to configure [`dynamicParams`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/route-segment-config#dynamicparams) in your root layout:

```tsx filename="src/app/[locale]/layout.tsx"
// Return a 404 for any unknown locales
export const dynamicParams = false;
```

If you don't use `generateStaticParams`, you can still disallow unknown locales by manually calling `notFound()` based on `params` in your root layout:

```tsx filename="src/app/[locale]/layout.tsx"
import {hasLocale} from 'next-intl';
import {notFound} from 'next/navigation';
import {routing} from '@/i18n/routing';

type Props = {
  children: React.ReactNode;
  params: Promise<{locale: string}>;
};

export default async function RootLayout({children, params}: Props) {
  const {locale} = await params;
  if (!hasLocale(routing.locales, locale)) {
    return notFound();
  }

  // ...
}
```

## Try `rootParams` today!

While this article mentions an upcoming `hasLocale` API from `next-intl@4.0` that simplifies working with `rootParams`, you can already try out the API today even in the `3.0` range.

The one rare case where a change from `next-intl@4.0` is required, is if you need to [manually pass a locale](#locale-override) to async APIs like `getTranslations` in case your UI renders multiple locales in parallel.

If you're giving `rootParams` a go with `next-intl`, let me know how it works for you by joining the discussion here: [Experiences with `rootParams`](https://github.com/amannn/next-intl/discussions/1627). I'm curious to hear how it simplifies your codebase!
