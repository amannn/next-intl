# Routing

`next-intl` integrates with Next.js' routing system in two places:

1. **Middleware**: Negotiates the locale and handles redirects & rewrites (e.g. `/` → `/en`)
2. **Navigation APIs**: Lightweight wrappers around Next.js' navigation APIs like `<Link />`

This enables you to express your app in terms of APIs like `<Link href="/about">`, while aspects like the locale and user-facing pathnames are automatically handled behind the scenes (e.g. `/de/über-uns`).
