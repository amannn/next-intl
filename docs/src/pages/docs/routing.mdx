# Routing

<Callout>
  Routing APIs are only needed when you're using [i18n
  routing](/docs/getting-started/app-router).
</Callout>

`next-intl` integrates with the routing system of Next.js in two places:

1. [**Middleware**](/docs/routing/middleware): Negotiates the locale and handles redirects & rewrites (e.g. `/` → `/en`)
2. [**Navigation APIs**](/docs/routing/navigation): Lightweight wrappers around Next.js' navigation APIs like `<Link />`

This enables you to express your app in terms of APIs like `<Link href="/about">`, while aspects like the locale and user-facing pathnames are automatically handled behind the scenes (e.g. `/de/ueber-uns`).

## `defineRouting`

The routing configuration that is shared between the [middleware](/docs/routing/middleware) and [the navigation APIs](/docs/routing/navigation) can be defined with the `defineRouting` function.

```tsx filename="src/i18n/routing.ts"
import {defineRouting} from 'next-intl/routing';

export const routing = defineRouting({
  // A list of all locales that are supported
  locales: ['en', 'de'],

  // Used when no locale matches
  defaultLocale: 'en'
});
```

Depending on your routing needs, you may wish to consider further settings—see below.

<Details id="locales-unknown">
<summary>What if the locales aren't known at build time?</summary>

In case you're building an app where locales can be added and removed at runtime, you can provide the routing configuration for the middleware [dynamically per request](/docs/routing/middleware#composing-other-middlewares).

To create the corresponding navigation APIs, you can [omit the `locales` argument](/docs/routing/navigation#locales-unknown) from `createNavigation` in this case.

Still, in case you're defining other routing config, make sure to keep them in sync between the middleware and the navigation APIs.

</Details>

### `localePrefix`

By default, the pathnames of your app will be available under a prefix that matches your directory structure (e.g. `/en/about` → `app/[locale]/about/page.tsx`). You can however adapt the routing to optionally remove the prefix or customize it per locale by configuring the `localePrefix` setting.

#### `localePrefix: 'always'` (default) [#locale-prefix-always]

By default, pathnames always start with the locale (e.g. `/en/about`).

```tsx filename="routing.ts" {5}
import {defineRouting} from 'next-intl/routing';

export const routing = defineRouting({
  // ...
  localePrefix: 'always'
});
```

#### `localePrefix: 'as-needed'` [#locale-prefix-as-needed]

If you want to use no prefix for the default locale (e.g. `/about`) while keeping it for other locales (e.g. `/de/about`), you can configure your routing accordingly:

```tsx filename="routing.ts" {5}
import {defineRouting} from 'next-intl/routing';

export const routing = defineRouting({
  // ...
  localePrefix: 'as-needed'
});
```

**Note that:**

1. If you use this routing strategy, make sure that your [middleware matcher](/docs/routing/middleware#matcher-config) detects unprefixed pathnames.
2. The middleware will by default set a [cookie](#locale-cookie) to remember the user's locale preference. If no explicit locale prefix is present in the pathname, then [locale detection](/docs/routing/middleware#locale-detection-prefix) will potentially redirect users to the latest locale that was matched based on the cookie value (e.g. `/` → `/de`).
3. If a superfluous locale prefix like `/en/about` is requested, the middleware will automatically redirect to the unprefixed version `/about`. This can be helpful in case you're redirecting from another locale and you want to update a potential cookie value first (e.g. [`<Link />`](/docs/routing/navigation#link) relies on this mechanism).

#### `localePrefix: 'never'` [#locale-prefix-never]

If you'd like to provide a locale to `next-intl`, e.g. based on user settings, you can consider setting up `next-intl` [without i18n routing](/docs/getting-started/app-router/without-i18n-routing). This way, you don't need to use the routing integration in the first place.

However, you can also configure the middleware to never show a locale prefix in the URL, which can be helpful in the following cases:

1. You want to use [domain-based routing](#domains) and have only one locale per domain
2. You want to use a cookie to determine the locale while enabling static rendering

```tsx filename="routing.ts" {5}
import {defineRouting} from 'next-intl/routing';

export const routing = defineRouting({
  // ...
  localePrefix: 'never'
});
```

In this case, requests for all locales will be rewritten to have the locale only prefixed internally. You still need to place all your pages inside a `[locale]` folder for the routes to be able to receive the `locale` param.

**Note that:**

1. If you use this routing strategy, make sure that your [middleware matcher](/docs/routing/middleware#matcher-config) detects unprefixed pathnames.
2. [Alternate links](#alternate-links) are disabled in this mode since URLs might not be unique per locale. Due to this, consider including these yourself, or set up a [sitemap](/docs/environments/actions-metadata-route-handlers#sitemap) that links localized pages via `alternates`.
3. You can consider increasing the [`maxAge`](#locale-cookie) attribute of the locale cookie to a longer duration to remember the user's preference across sessions.

#### `prefixes` [#locale-prefix-prefixes]

If you'd like to customize the user-facing prefix, you can provide a locale-based mapping:

```tsx filename="routing.ts"
import {defineRouting} from 'next-intl/routing';

export const routing = defineRouting({
  locales: ['en-US', 'de-AT', 'zh'],
  defaultLocale: 'en-US',
  localePrefix: {
    mode: 'always',
    prefixes: {
      'en-US': '/us',
      'de-AT': '/eu/at'
      // (/zh will be used as-is)
    }
  }
});
```

**Note that:**

1. You should adapt your [middleware matcher](/docs/routing/middleware#matcher-config) to match the custom prefixes.
2. Custom prefixes are only visible to the user and rewritten internally to the corresponding locale. Therefore, the `[locale]` segment corresponds to the locale, not the prefix.

<Details id="locale-prefix-custom-read-prefix">
<summary>Can I read the matched prefix in my app?</summary>

Since the custom prefix is rewritten to the locale internally, you can't access the prefix directly. However, you can extract details like the region from the locale:

```tsx
import {useLocale} from 'next-intl';

function Component() {
  // Assuming the locale is 'en-US'
  const locale = useLocale();

  // Extracts the "US" region
  const {region} = new Intl.Locale(locale);
}
```

The region must be a valid [ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2#Officially_assigned_code_elements) or a [UN M49 region code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_M49#Code_lists). When passed to `Intl.Locale`, the region code is treated as case-insensitive and normalized to uppercase. You can also combine languages with regions where the language is not natively spoken (e.g. `en-AT` describes English as used in Austria).

Apart from the region, a locale can [encode further properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/Locale#description), like the numbering system.

If you'd like to encode custom information in the locale, you can use arbitrary [private extensions](https://tc39.es/proposal-intl-locale/#sec-insert-unicode-extension-and-canonicalize), denoted by the `-x-` prefix (e.g. `en-US-x-usd`). The `Intl.Locale` constructor ignores private extensions, but you can extract them from the locale string manually.

</Details>

### `pathnames` [#pathnames]

Many apps choose to localize pathnames, especially when search engine optimization is relevant.

**Example:**

- `/en/about`
- `/de/ueber-uns`

Since you typically want to define these routes only once internally, you can use the `next-intl` middleware to [rewrite](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next.config.js/rewrites) such incoming requests to shared pathnames.

```tsx filename="routing.ts"
import {defineRouting} from 'next-intl/routing';

export const routing = defineRouting({
  locales: ['en-US', 'en-UK', 'de'],
  defaultLocale: 'en-US',

  // The `pathnames` object holds pairs of internal and
  // external paths. Based on the locale, the external
  // paths are rewritten to the shared, internal ones.
  pathnames: {
    // If all locales use the same pathname, a single
    // external path can be used for all locales
    '/': '/',
    '/blog': '/blog',

    // If some locales use different paths, you can
    // specify the relevant external pathnames
    '/about': {
      de: '/ueber-uns'
    },

    // Dynamic params are supported via square brackets
    '/news/[articleSlug]': {
      de: '/neuigkeiten/[articleSlug]'
    },

    // Static pathnames that overlap with dynamic segments
    // will be prioritized over the dynamic segment
    '/news/just-in': {
      de: '/neuigkeiten/aktuell'
    },

    // Also (optional) catch-all segments are supported
    '/categories/[...slug]': {
      de: '/kategorien/[...slug]'
    }
  }
});
```

Localized pathnames map to a single internal pathname that is created via the file-system based routing in Next.js. In the example above, `/de/ueber-uns` will be handled by the page at `/[locale]/about/page.tsx`.

<Details id="localized-pathnames-revalidation">
<summary>How can I revalidate localized pathnames?</summary>

Depending on if a route is generated statically (at build time) or dynamically (at runtime), [`revalidatePath`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/revalidatePath) needs to be called either for the localized or the internal pathname.

Consider this example:

```
app
└── [locale]
    └── news
        └── [slug]
```

… with this routing configuration:

```tsx filename="routing.ts"
import {defineRouting} from 'next-intl/routing';

export const routing = defineRouting({
  locales: ['en', 'de'],
  defaultLocale: 'en',
  pathnames: {
    '/news/[slug]': {
      en: '/news/[slug]',
      de: '/neuigkeiten/[slug]'
    }
  }
});
```

Depending on whether `some-article` was included in [`generateStaticParams`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-static-params) or not, you can revalidate the route like this:

```tsx
// Statically generated at build time
revalidatePath('/de/news/some-article');

// Dynamically generated at runtime:
revalidatePath('/de/neuigkeiten/some-article');
```

When in doubt, you can revalidate with `revalidateTag` instead.

See also: [`vercel/next.js#59825`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/59825)

</Details>

<Details id="localized-pathnames-dynamic-segments">
<summary>How can I localize dynamic segments?</summary>

If you have a route like `/news/[articleSlug]-[articleId]`, you may want to localize the `articleSlug` part in the pathname like this:

```
/en/news/launch-of-new-product-94812
/de/neuigkeiten/produktneuheit-94812
```

In this case, the localized slug can either be provided by the backend or generated in the frontend by slugifying the localized article title.

A good practice is to include the ID in the URL, allowing you to retrieve the article based on this information from the backend. The ID can be further used to implement [self-healing URLs](https://mikebifulco.com/posts/self-healing-urls-nextjs-seo), where a redirect is added if the `articleSlug` doesn't match.

If you localize the values for dynamic segments, you might want to turn off [alternate links](#alternate-links) and provide your own implementation that considers localized values for dynamic segments.

</Details>

<Details id="localized-pathnames-cms">
<summary>How do I integrate with an external system like a CMS that provides localized pathnames?</summary>

In case you're using a system like a CMS to configure localized pathnames, you'll typically implement this with a dynamic segment that catches all localized pathnames _instead_ of using the `pathnames` configuration from `next-intl`.

**Examples:**

1. All pathnames are handled by your CMS: `[locale]/[[...slug]]/page.tsx`
2. Some pathnames are handled by your CMS: `[locale]/blog/[...slug]/page.tsx`

```tsx filename="page.tsx"
import {notFound} from 'next';
import {Locale} from 'next-intl';
import {fetchContent} from './cms';

type Props = {
  params: Promise<{
    locale: Locale;
    slug: Array<string>;
  }>;
};

export default async function CatchAllPage({params}: Props) {
  const {locale, slug} = await params;
  const content = await fetchContent(locale, slug);
  if (!content) notFound();

  // ...
}
```

In this case, you'll likely want to disable [alternate links](#alternate-links) and provide your own implementation instead.

Furthermore, in case you provide a locale switcher, it might require special care to be able to switch between localized pathnames of the same page. A simplified implementation might always redirect to the home page instead.

</Details>

### `domains`

If you want to serve your localized content based on different domains, you can provide a list of mappings between domains and locales via the `domains` setting.

**Examples:**

- `us.example.com`: `en-US`
- `ca.example.com`: `en-CA`
- `ca.example.com/fr`: `fr-CA`
- `fr.example.com`: `fr-FR`

In many cases, `domains` are combined with a [`localePrefix`](#locale-prefix) setting to achieve results as shown above. Also [custom prefixes](#locale-prefix-prefixes) can be used to customize the user-facing prefix per locale.

```tsx filename="routing.ts"
import {defineRouting} from 'next-intl/routing';

export const routing = defineRouting({
  locales: ['en-US', 'en-CA', 'fr-CA', 'fr-FR'],
  defaultLocale: 'en-US',
  domains: [
    {
      domain: 'us.example.com',
      defaultLocale: 'en-US',
      locales: ['en-US']
    },
    {
      domain: 'ca.example.com',
      defaultLocale: 'en-CA',
      locales: ['en-CA', 'fr-CA']
    },
    {
      domain: 'fr.example.com',
      defaultLocale: 'fr-FR',
      locales: ['fr-FR']
    }
  ],
  localePrefix: {
    mode: 'as-needed',
    prefixes: {
      // Cleaner prefix for `ca.example.com/fr`
      'fr-CA': '/fr'
    }
  }
});
```

Locales are required to be unique across domains, therefore regional variants are typically used to avoid conflicts. Note however that you don't necessarily need to [provide messages for each locale](/docs/usage/configuration#messages-per-locale) if the overall language is sufficient for your use case.

If no domain matches, the middleware will fall back to default locale matching based on [prefixes](/docs/routing/middleware#location-detection-prefix) (e.g. on `localhost`, for local development).

<Details id="domains-testing">
<summary>How can I locally test if my setup is working?</summary>

To test your domain setup locally, you can conditionally adapt the domains to refer to hosts that are available locally:

```tsx filename="routing.ts"
import {defineRouting} from 'next-intl/routing';

const isDev = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development';

export const routing = defineConfig({
  // ...
  domains: [
    {
      domain: isDev ? 'localhost:3000' : 'us.example.com'
      // ...
    },
    {
      domain: isDev ? 'localhost:3001' : 'ca.example.com'
      // ...
    }
  ]
});
```

Now, you can run your development server on one of the configured ports and test the routing for different use cases:

```sh
# Like `us.example.com`
PORT=3000 npm run dev

# Like `ca.example.com`
PORT=3001 npm run dev
```

</Details>

<Details id="domains-localeprefix-individual">
<summary>Can I use a different `localePrefix` setting per domain?</summary>

While this is currently not supported out of the box, you can still achieve this by building the app for each domain separately while injecting diverging routing configuration via an environment variable.

**Example:**

```tsx filename="routing.ts"
import {defineRouting} from 'next-intl/routing';

const isUsDomain =
  process.env.VERCEL_PROJECT_PRODUCTION_URL === 'us.example.com';

export const routing = defineRouting({
  locales: isUsDomain ? ['en-US'] : ['en-CA', 'fr-CA'],
  defaultLocale: isUsDomain ? 'en-US' : 'en-CA',
  localePrefix: isUsDomain ? 'never' : 'always'
});
```

</Details>

### `localeDetection` [#locale-detection]

The middleware will [detect a matching locale](/docs/routing/middleware#locale-detection) based on your routing configuration & the incoming request and will either pass the request through for a matching locale or redirect to one that matches.

If you want to rely entirely on the URL to resolve the locale, you can set the `localeDetection` property to `false`. This will disable locale detection based on the `accept-language` header and a potentially existing cookie value from a previous visit.

```tsx filename="routing.ts" {5}
import {defineRouting} from 'next-intl/routing';

export const routing = defineRouting({
  // ...
  localeDetection: false
});
```

In this case, only the locale prefix and a potentially [matching domain](#domains) are used to determine the locale.

### `localeCookie` [#locale-cookie]

If a user changes the locale to a value that doesn't match the `accept-language` header, `next-intl` will set a session cookie called `NEXT_LOCALE` that contains the most recently detected locale. This is used to [remember the user's locale](/docs/routing/middleware#locale-detection) preference for subsequent requests.

By default, the cookie will be configured with the following attributes:

2. [**`sameSite`**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cookie#samesitesamesite-value): This value is set to `lax` so that the cookie can be set when coming from an external site.
3. [**`path`**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cookie#pathpath-value): This value is not set by default, but will use the value of your [`basePath`](#basepath) if configured.

If you have more specific requirements, you can adjust these settings accordingly:

```tsx filename="routing.ts"
import {defineRouting} from 'next-intl/routing';

export const routing = defineRouting({
  // ...

  // Will be merged with the defaults
  localeCookie: {
    // Custom cookie name
    name: 'USER_LOCALE',
    // Expire in one year
    maxAge: 60 * 60 * 24 * 365
  }
});
```

… or turn the cookie off entirely:

```tsx filename="routing.ts"
import {defineRouting} from 'next-intl/routing';

export const routing = defineRouting({
  // ...

  localeCookie: false
});
```

<Details id="locale-cookie-gdpr">
<summary>Which `maxAge` value should I consider for GDPR compliance?</summary>

The [Article 29 Working Party opinion 04/2012](https://ec.europa.eu/justice/article-29/documentation/opinion-recommendation/files/2012/wp194_en.pdf) provides a guideline for the expiration of cookies that are used to remember the user's language in section 3.6 "UI customization cookies". In this policy, a language preference cookie set as a result of an explicit user action, such as using a language switcher, is allowed to remain active for "a few additional hours" after a browser session has ended.

To be compliant out of the box, `next-intl` does not set the `max-age` value of the cookie, making it a session cookie that expires when a browser is closed.

Note that this can be beneficial in comparison to an expiration of a few hours since the cookie is guaranteed to remain active while the browser session lasts. On mobile devices, where browsers are infrequently closed but rather suspended to the background, the cookie can remain active even for an extended period.

The Working Party also states that if additional information about the use of cookies is provided in a prominent location (e.g. a "uses cookies" notice next to the language switcher), the cookie can be configured to remember the user's preference for "a longer duration". If you're providing such a notice, you can consider increasing `maxAge` accordingly.

Please note that legal requirements may vary by region, so it's advisable to verify them independently. While we strive to keep this information as up-to-date as possible, we cannot guarantee its accuracy.

</Details>

### `alternateLinks` (`hreflang`) [#alternate-links]

The middleware automatically sets [the `link` header](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/specialty/international/localized-versions#http) to inform search engines that your content is available in different languages. Note that this automatically integrates with your routing strategy and will generate the correct links based on your configuration.

However, there are cases where you may want to provide these links yourself:

1. You have pages that are only available for certain locales
2. You're using an external system like a CMS to manage pathnames of your pages

In this case, you can opt-out of this behavior by setting `alternateLinks` to `false`.

```tsx filename="routing.ts"
import {defineRouting} from 'next-intl/routing';

export const routing = defineRouting({
  // ...

  alternateLinks: false
});
```

If you decide to manage alternate links yourself, a good option can be to include them in a [sitemap](/docs/environments/actions-metadata-route-handlers#sitemap).

<Details id="alternate-links-details">
<summary>Which alternate links are included?</summary>

Using the middleware defaults, the `link` header of a response for `/` will look like this:

```
link: <https://example.com/en>; rel="alternate"; hreflang="en",
      <https://example.com/de>; rel="alternate"; hreflang="de",
      <https://example.com/>; rel="alternate"; hreflang="x-default"
```

The [`x-default`](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/specialty/international/localized-versions#xdefault) entry is included to point to a variant that can be used if no other language matches the user's browser setting. This special entry is reserved for language selection & detection, in our case issuing a 307 redirect to the best matching locale.

Your middleware configuration, including options like `domains`, `pathnames` and `basePath`, is automatically incorporated.

</Details>

<Details id="alternate-links-customization">
<summary>Can I customize the alternate links?</summary>

If you need to customize the alternate links, you can either turn them off and provide your own implementation, or if you only need to make minor adaptions, you can [compose the middleware](#composing-other-middlewares) and add your custom logic after the middleware has run:

```tsx filename="middleware.ts"
import createMiddleware from 'next-intl/middleware';
import LinkHeader from 'http-link-header';
import {NextRequest} from 'next/server';
import {routing} from './i18n/routing';

const handleI18nRouting = createMiddleware(routing);

export default async function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
  const response = handleI18nRouting(request);

  // Example: Remove the `x-default` entry
  const link = LinkHeader.parse(response.headers.get('link'));
  link.refs = link.refs.filter((entry) => entry.hreflang !== 'x-default');
  response.headers.set('link', link.toString());

  return response;
}
```

</Details>

## `next.config.ts` [#next-config]

Apart from your routing configuration, `next-intl` will also incorporate settings from [`next.config.ts`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/config/next-config-js).

### `basePath`

The `next-intl` middleware as well as [the navigation APIs](/docs/routing/navigation) will automatically pick up a [`basePath`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/basePath) that you might have configured in your `next.config.js`.

Note however that you should make sure that your [middleware `matcher`](#matcher-config) handles the root of your base path:

```tsx filename="middleware.ts"
export const config = {
  // The `matcher` is relative to the `basePath`
  matcher: [
    // This entry handles the root of the base
    // path and should always be included
    '/'

    // ... other matcher config
  ]
};
```

### `trailingSlash`

If you have [`trailingSlash`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/trailingSlash) set to `true` in your Next.js config, this setting will be taken into account by the middleware and the navigation APIs.

Note that if you're using [`pathnames`](#pathnames), your internal and external pathnames can be defined either with or without a trailing slash as they will be normalized internally.
