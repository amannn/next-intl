# Environments

The `next-intl` APIs are available in the following environments:

<Cards className="mt-8 lg:w-1/2">
  <Card
    title="Server & Client Components"
    href="/docs/environments/server-client-components"
  />
  <Card
    title="Server Actions, Metadata & Route Handlers"
    href="/docs/environments/actions-metadata-route-handlers"
  />
  <Card
    title="Error files (e.g. not-found)"
    href="/docs/environments/error-files"
  />
  <Card title="Markdown (MDX)" href="/docs/environments/mdx" />
  <Card
    title="Core library (agnostic)"
    href="/docs/environments/core-library"
  />
</Cards>

While modern browsers and server runtimes typically support all necessary JavaScript APIs that are required for `next-intl`, you can double check [the runtime requirements](/docs/environments/runtime-requirements).
