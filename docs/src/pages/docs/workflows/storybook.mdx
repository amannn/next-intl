# Storybook integration for `next-intl`

[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) is a tool for developing UI components in isolation.

If you like to set up stories for components that use `next-intl`, you can use [`storybook-next-intl`](https://github.com/stevensacks/storybook-next-intl), a community-maintained addon that configures Storybook accordingly for you.

**Features**

- Sets up [`NextIntlClientProvider`](/docs/usage/configuration#nextintlclientprovider) globally for you
- Provides a locale switcher so you can test components with different locales

**Tip:** If you declare components that render as Server Components in your app via non-async functions, these components can render as Client Components in Storybook and will consume configuration from `NextIntlClientProvider` (see also: [Non-async components](/docs/environments/server-client-components#shared-components)).
