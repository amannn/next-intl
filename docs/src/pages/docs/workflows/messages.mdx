# Validating messages

To ensure quality and completeness of your messages, you can use [i18n-check](https://github.com/lingualdev/i18n-check).

This CLI tool helps you validate against issues like:

1. Missing translations in target locales
2. Inconsistent usage of ICU arguments across translations

**Usage:**

```bash
i18n-check --source en --locales messages
```

Additionally, you can use the [`--unused`](https://github.com/lingualdev/i18n-check#--unused--u) flag to detect keys that are defined in your messages but are not referenced anywhere in your codebase (currently experimental).
