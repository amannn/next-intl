# App Router setup with i18n routing

In order to use unique pathnames for every language that your app supports, `next-intl` can be used to handle the following routing setups:

1. Prefix-based routing (e.g. `/en/about`)
2. Domain-based routing (e.g. `en.example.com/about`)

In either case, `next-intl` integrates with the App Router by using a top-level `[locale]` [dynamic segment](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes) that can be used to provide content in different languages.

## Getting started

If you haven't done so already, [create a Next.js app](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/installation) that uses the App Router and run:

```sh
npm install next-intl
```

Now, we're going to create the following file structure:

```
├── messages
│   ├── en.json (1)
│   └── ...
├── next.config.mjs (2)
└── src
    ├── i18n
    │   ├── routing.ts (3)
    │   └── request.ts (5)
    ├── middleware.ts (4)
    └── app
        └── [locale]
            ├── layout.tsx (6)
            └── page.tsx (7)
```

In case you're migrating an existing app to `next-intl`, you'll typically move your existing pages into the `[locale]` folder as part of the setup.

**Let's set up the files:**

<Steps>

### `messages/en.json` [#messages]

Messages represent the translations that are available per language and can be provided either locally or loaded from a remote data source.

The simplest option is to add JSON files in your local project folder:

```json filename="messages/en.json"
{
  "HomePage": {
    "title": "Hello world!",
    "about": "Go to the about page"
  }
}
```

### `next.config.mjs` [#next-config]

Now, set up the plugin which creates an alias to provide a request-specific i18n configuration to Server Components—more on this in the following steps.

<Tabs items={['next.config.mjs', 'next.config.js']}>
<Tabs.Tab>

```js filename="next.config.mjs"
import createNextIntlPlugin from 'next-intl/plugin';

const withNextIntl = createNextIntlPlugin();

/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {};

export default withNextIntl(nextConfig);
```

</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>

```js filename="next.config.js"
const createNextIntlPlugin = require('next-intl/plugin');

const withNextIntl = createNextIntlPlugin();

/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {};

module.exports = withNextIntl(nextConfig);
```

</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

### `src/i18n/routing.ts` [#i18n-routing]

We'll integrate with Next.js' routing in two places:

1. **Middleware**: Negotiates the locale and handles redirects & rewrites (e.g. `/` → `/en`)
2. **Navigation APIs**: Lightweight wrappers around Next.js' navigation APIs like `<Link />`

This enables you to work with pathnames like `/about`, while i18n aspects like language prefixes are handled behind the scenes.

To share the configuration between these two places, we'll set up `routing.ts`:

```ts filename="src/i18n/routing.ts"
import {defineRouting} from 'next-intl/routing';
import {createNavigation} from 'next-intl/navigation';

export const routing = defineRouting({
  // A list of all locales that are supported
  locales: ['en', 'de'],

  // Used when no locale matches
  defaultLocale: 'en'
});

// Lightweight wrappers around Next.js' navigation APIs
// that will consider the routing configuration
export const {Link, redirect, usePathname, useRouter} =
  createNavigation(routing);
```

Depending on your requirements, you may wish to customize your routing configuration later—but let's finish with the setup first.

### `src/middleware.ts` [#middleware]

Once we have our routing configuration in place, we can use it to set up the middleware.

```tsx filename="src/middleware.ts"
import createMiddleware from 'next-intl/middleware';
import {routing} from './i18n/routing';

export default createMiddleware(routing);

export const config = {
  // Match only internationalized pathnames
  matcher: ['/', '/(de|en)/:path*']
};
```

### `src/i18n/request.ts` [#i18n-request]

When using features from `next-intl` in Server Components, the relevant configuration is read from a central module that is located at `i18n/request.ts` by convention. This configuration is scoped to the current request and can be used to provide messages and other options based on the user's locale.

```tsx filename="src/i18n/request.ts"
import {getRequestConfig} from 'next-intl/server';
import {hasLocale} from 'next-intl';
import {routing} from './routing';

export default getRequestConfig(async ({requestLocale}) => {
  // Typically corresponds to the `[locale]` segment
  const requested = await requestLocale;
  const locale = hasLocale(routing.locales, requested)
    ? requested
    : routing.defaultLocale;

  return {
    locale,
    messages: (await import(`../../messages/${locale}.json`)).default
  };
});
```

<Details id="i18n-request-path">
<summary>Can I move this file somewhere else?</summary>

This file is supported out-of-the-box as `./i18n/request.ts` both in the `src` folder as well as in the project root with the extensions `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.js` and `.jsx`.

If you prefer to move this file somewhere else, you can optionally provide a path to the plugin:

```js filename="next.config.mjs"
const withNextIntl = createNextIntlPlugin(
  // Specify a custom path here
  './somewhere/else/request.ts'
);
```

</Details>

### `src/app/[locale]/layout.tsx` [#layout]

The `locale` that was matched by the middleware is available via the `locale` param and can be used to configure the document language. Additionally, we can use this place to pass configuration from `i18n/request.ts` to Client Components via `NextIntlClientProvider`.

```tsx filename="app/[locale]/layout.tsx"
import {NextIntlClientProvider, Locale, hasLocale} from 'next-intl';
import {getMessages} from 'next-intl/server';
import {notFound} from 'next/navigation';
import {routing} from '@/i18n/routing';

export default async function LocaleLayout({
  children,
  params: {locale}
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode;
  params: {locale: Locale};
}) {
  if (!hasLocale(routing.locales, locale)) {
    notFound();
  }

  // Providing all messages to the client
  // side is the easiest way to get started
  const messages = await getMessages();

  return (
    <html lang={locale}>
      <body>
        <NextIntlClientProvider messages={messages}>
          {children}
        </NextIntlClientProvider>
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

Note that `NextIntlClientProvider` automatically inherits configuration from `i18n/request.ts` here, but `messages` need to be passed explicitly.

### `src/app/[locale]/page.tsx` [#page]

And that's it!

Now you can use translations and other functionality from `next-intl` in your components:

```tsx filename="app/[locale]/page.tsx"
import {useTranslations} from 'next-intl';
import {Link} from '@/i18n/routing';

export default function HomePage() {
  const t = useTranslations('HomePage');
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{t('title')}</h1>
      <Link href="/about">{t('about')}</Link>
    </div>
  );
}
```

</Steps>

## Static rendering

When using the setup with i18n routing, `next-intl` will currently opt into dynamic rendering when APIs like `useTranslations` are used in Server Components. This is a limitation that we aim to remove in the future, but as a stopgap solution, `next-intl` provides a temporary API that can be used to enable static rendering.

<Steps>

### Add `generateStaticParams`

Since we are using a dynamic route segment for the `[locale]` param, we need to pass all possible values to Next.js via [`generateStaticParams`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-static-params) so that the routes can be rendered at build time.

Depending on your needs, you can add `generateStaticParams` either to a layout or pages:

1. **Layout**: Enables static rendering for all pages within this layout (e.g. `app/[locale]/layout.tsx`)
2. **Individual pages**: Enables static rendering for a specific page (e.g. `app/[locale]/page.tsx`)

**Example:**

```tsx
import {routing} from '@/i18n/routing';

export function generateStaticParams() {
  return routing.locales.map((locale) => ({locale}));
}
```

### Add `setRequestLocale` to all relevant layouts and pages

`next-intl` provides an API that can be used to distribute the locale that is received via `params` in layouts and pages for usage in all Server Components that are rendered as part of the request.

```tsx filename="app/[locale]/layout.tsx"
import {setRequestLocale} from 'next-intl/server';
import {hasLocale} from 'next-intl';
import {notFound} from 'next/navigation';
import {routing} from '@/i18n/routing';

export default async function LocaleLayout({children, params: {locale}}) {
  if (!hasLocale(routing.locales, locale)) {
    notFound();
  }

  // Enable static rendering
  setRequestLocale(locale);

  return (
    // ...
  );
}
```

```tsx filename="app/[locale]/page.tsx"
import {setRequestLocale} from 'next-intl/server';

export default function IndexPage({params: {locale}}) {
  // Enable static rendering
  setRequestLocale(locale);

  // Once the request locale is set, you
  // can call hooks from `next-intl`
  const t = useTranslations('IndexPage');

  return (
    // ...
  );
}
```

**Keep in mind that:**

1. The locale that you pass to `setRequestLocale` should be validated (e.g. in your [root layout](#layout)).
2. You need to call this function in every page and every layout that you intend to enable static rendering for since Next.js can render layouts and pages independently.
3. `setRequestLocale` needs to be called before you invoke any functions from `next-intl` like `useTranslations` or `getMessages`.

<Details id="setrequestlocale-implementation">
<summary>How does setRequestLocale work?</summary>

`next-intl` uses [`cache()`](https://react.dev/reference/react/cache) to create a mutable store that holds the current locale. By calling `setRequestLocale`, the current locale will be written to the store, making it available to all APIs that require the locale.

Note that the store is scoped to a request and therefore doesn't affect other requests that might be handled in parallel while a given request resolves asynchronously.

</Details>

<Details id="setrequestlocale-background">
<summary>Why is this API necessary?</summary>

Next.js currently doesn't provide an API to read route params like `locale` at arbitrary places in Server Components (see [`vercel/next.js`#58862](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/58862)). The `locale` is fundamental to all APIs provided by `next-intl`, therefore passing this as a prop throughout the tree doesn't stand out as particularly ergonomic.

Due to this, `next-intl` uses its middleware to attach an `x-next-intl-locale` header to the incoming request, holding the negotiated locale as a value. This technique allows the locale to be read at arbitrary places via `headers().get('x-next-intl-locale')`.

However, the usage of `headers` opts the route into dynamic rendering.

By using `setRequestLocale`, you can provide the locale that is received in layouts and pages via `params` to `next-intl`. All APIs from `next-intl` can now read from this value instead of the header, enabling static rendering.

</Details>

### Use the `locale` param in metadata

In addition to the rendering of your pages, also page metadata needs to qualify for static rendering.

To achieve this, you can forward the `locale` that you receive from Next.js via `params` to [the awaitable functions from `next-intl`](/docs/environments/server-client-components#async-components).

```tsx filename="page.tsx"
import {getTranslations} from 'next-intl/server';

export async function generateMetadata({params: {locale}}) {
  const t = await getTranslations({locale, namespace: 'Metadata'});

  return {
    title: t('title')
  };
}
```

</Steps>
