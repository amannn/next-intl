# Middleware

<Callout>
  The middleware is only needed when you're using [i18n
  routing](/docs/getting-started/app-router).
</Callout>

The middleware receives a [`routing`](/docs/routing#define-routing) configuration and takes care of:

1. Locale negotiation
2. Applying relevant redirects & rewrites
3. Providing [alternate links](/docs/routing#alternate-links) for search engines

**Example:**

```tsx filename="middleware.ts"
import createMiddleware from 'next-intl/middleware';
import {routing} from './i18n/routing';

export default createMiddleware(routing);

export const config = {
  // Match only internationalized pathnames
  matcher: ['/', '/(de|en)/:path*']
};
```

## Locale detection [#locale-detection]

The locale is negotiated based on your [`localePrefix`](/docs/routing#locale-prefix) and [`domains`](/docs/routing#domains) setting. Once a locale is detected, it will be remembered for future requests by being stored in the `NEXT_LOCALE` cookie.

### Prefix-based routing (default) [#location-detection-prefix]

By default, [prefix-based routing](/docs/routing#locale-prefix) is used to determine the locale of a request.

In this case, the locale is detected based on these priorities:

1. A locale prefix is present in the pathname (e.g. `/en/about`)
2. A cookie is present that contains a previously detected locale
3. A locale can be matched based on the [`accept-language` header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept-Language)
4. As a last resort, the `defaultLocale` is used

To change the locale, users can visit a prefixed route. This will take precedence over a previously matched locale that is saved in a cookie or the `accept-language` header and will update the previous cookie value.

**Example workflow:**

1. A user requests `/` and based on the `accept-language` header, the `en` locale is matched.
2. The `en` locale is saved in a cookie and the user is redirected to `/en`.
3. The app renders `<Link locale="de" href="/">Switch to German</Link>` to allow the user to change the locale to `de`.
4. When the user clicks on the link, a request to `/de` is initiated.
5. The middleware will update the cookie value to `de`.

<Details id="accept-language-matching">
<summary>Which algorithm is used to match the accept-language header against the available locales?</summary>

To determine the best-matching locale based on the available options from your app, the middleware uses the "best fit" algorithm of [`@formatjs/intl-localematcher`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@formatjs/intl-localematcher). This algorithm is expected to provide better results than the more conservative "lookup" algorithm that is specified in [RFC 4647](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4647.html#section-3.4).

To illustrate this with an example, let's consider your app supports these locales:

1. `en-US`
2. `de-DE`

The "lookup" algorithm works by progressively removing subtags from the user's `accept-language` header until a match is found. This means that if the user's browser sends the `accept-language` header `en-GB`, the "lookup" algorithm will not find a match, resulting in the default locale being used.

In contrast, the "best fit" algorithm compares a _distance_ between the user's `accept-language` header and the available locales, while taking into consideration regional information. Due to this, the "best fit" algorithm is able to match `en-US` as the best-matching locale in this case.

</Details>

### Domain-based routing [#location-detection-domain]

If you're using [domain-based routing](/docs/routing#domains), the middleware will match the request against the available domains to determine the best-matching locale. To retrieve the domain, the host is read from the `x-forwarded-host` header, with a fallback to `host` (hosting platforms typically provide these headers out-of-the-box).

The locale is detected based on these priorities:

1. A locale prefix is present in the pathname (e.g. `ca.example.com/fr`)
2. A locale is stored in a cookie and is supported on the domain
3. A locale that the domain supports is matched based on the [`accept-language` header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept-Language)
4. As a fallback, the `defaultLocale` of the domain is used

Since the middleware is aware of all your domains, if a domain receives a request for a locale that is not supported (e.g. `en.example.com/fr`), it will redirect to an alternative domain that does support the locale.

**Example workflow:**

1. The user requests `us.example.com` and based on the `defaultLocale` of this domain, the `en` locale is matched.
2. The app renders `<Link locale="fr" href="/">Switch to French</Link>` to allow the user to change the locale to `fr`.
3. When the link is clicked, a request to `us.example.com/fr` is initiated.
4. The middleware recognizes that the user wants to switch to another domain and responds with a redirect to `ca.example.com/fr`.

<Details id="domain-matching">
<summary>How is the best matching domain for a given locale detected?</summary>

The bestmatching domain is detected based on these priorities:

1. Stay on the current domain if the locale is supported here
2. Use an alternative domain where the locale is configured as the `defaultLocale`
3. Use an alternative domain where the available `locales` are restricted and the locale is supported
4. Use an alternative domain that supports all locales

</Details>

## Matcher config

The middleware is intended to only run on pages, not on arbitrary files that you serve independently of the user locale (e.g. `/favicon.ico`).

Because of this, the following config is generally recommended:

```tsx filename="middleware.ts"
export const config = {
  // Match only internationalized pathnames
  matcher: ['/', '/(de|en)/:path*']
};
```

This enables:

1. A redirect at `/` to a suitable locale
2. Internationalization of all pathnames starting with a locale (e.g. `/en/about`)

<Details id="matcher-avoid-hardcoding">
<summary>Can I avoid hardcoding the locales in the `matcher` config?</summary>

A [Next.js `matcher`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware#matcher) needs to be statically analyzable, therefore you can't use variables to generate this value. However, you can alternatively implement a programmatic condition in the middleware:

```tsx filename="middleware.ts"
import {NextRequest} from 'next/server';
import createMiddleware from 'next-intl/middleware';
import {routing} from './i18n/routing';

const handleI18nRouting = createMiddleware(routing);

export default function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
  const {pathname} = request.nextUrl;

  // Matches '/', as well as all paths that start with a locale like '/en'
  const shouldHandle =
    pathname === '/' ||
    new RegExp(`^/(${locales.join('|')})(/.*)?$`).test(
      request.nextUrl.pathname
    );
  if (!shouldHandle) return;

  return handleI18nRouting(request);
}
```

</Details>

### Pathnames without a locale prefix [#matcher-no-prefix]

There are two use cases where you might want to match pathnames without a locale prefix:

1. You're using a config for [`localePrefix`](/docs/routing#locale-prefix) other than [`always`](/docs/routing#locale-prefix-always)
2. You want to enable redirects that add a locale for unprefixed pathnames (e.g. `/about` → `/en/about`)

For these cases, the middleware should run on requests for pathnames without a locale prefix as well.

A popular strategy is to match all routes that don't start with certain segments (e.g. `/_next`) and also none that include a dot (`.`) since these typically indicate static files. However, if you have some routes where a dot is expected (e.g. `/users/jane.doe`), you should explicitly provide a matcher for these.

```tsx filename="middleware.ts"
export const config = {
  // Matcher entries are linked with a logical "or", therefore
  // if one of them matches, the middleware will be invoked.
  matcher: [
    // Match all pathnames except for
    // - … if they start with `/api`, `/_next` or `/_vercel`
    // - … the ones containing a dot (e.g. `favicon.ico`)
    '/((?!api|_next|_vercel|.*\\..*).*)',
    // However, match all pathnames within `/users`, optionally with a locale prefix
    '/([\\w-]+)?/users/(.+)'
  ]
};
```

{/* Keep this in sync with `packages/next-intl/test/middleware/middleware.test.tsx` */}

Note that some third-party providers like [Vercel Analytics](https://vercel.com/analytics) typically use internal endpoints that are then rewritten to an external URL (e.g. `/_vercel/insights/view`). Make sure to exclude such requests from your middleware matcher so they aren't rewritten by accident.

## Composing other middlewares

By calling `createMiddleware`, you'll receive a function of the following type:

```tsx
function middleware(request: NextRequest): NextResponse;
```

If you need to incorporate additional behavior, you can either modify the request before the `next-intl` middleware receives it, modify the response or even create the middleware based on dynamic configuration.

```tsx filename="middleware.ts"
import createMiddleware from 'next-intl/middleware';
import {NextRequest} from 'next/server';

export default async function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
  // Step 1: Use the incoming request (example)
  const defaultLocale = request.headers.get('x-your-custom-locale') || 'en';

  // Step 2: Create and call the next-intl middleware (example)
  const handleI18nRouting = createMiddleware({
    locales: ['en', 'de'],
    defaultLocale
  });
  const response = handleI18nRouting(request);

  // Step 3: Alter the response (example)
  response.headers.set('x-your-custom-locale', defaultLocale);

  return response;
}

export const config = {
  // Match only internationalized pathnames
  matcher: ['/', '/(de|en)/:path*']
};
```

### Example: Additional rewrites

If you need to handle rewrites apart from the ones provided by `next-intl`, you can adjust the `pathname` of the `request` before invoking the `next-intl` middleware (based on ["A/B Testing with Cookies" by Vercel](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/cookies)).

This example rewrites requests for `/[locale]/profile` to `/[locale]/profile/new` if a special cookie is set.

```tsx filename="middleware.ts"
import createMiddleware from 'next-intl/middleware';
import {NextRequest} from 'next/server';

export default async function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
  const [, locale, ...segments] = request.nextUrl.pathname.split('/');

  if (locale != null && segments.join('/') === 'profile') {
    const usesNewProfile =
      (request.cookies.get('NEW_PROFILE')?.value || 'false') === 'true';

    if (usesNewProfile) {
      request.nextUrl.pathname = `/${locale}/profile/new`;
    }
  }

  const handleI18nRouting = createMiddleware({
    locales: ['en', 'de'],
    defaultLocale: 'en'
  });
  const response = handleI18nRouting(request);
  return response;
}

export const config = {
  matcher: ['/', '/(de|en)/:path*']
};
```

Note that if you use a [`localePrefix`](/docs/routing#locale-prefix) other than `always`, you need to adapt the handling appropriately to handle unprefixed pathnames too. Also, make sure to only rewrite pathnames that will not lead to a redirect, as otherwise rewritten pathnames will be redirected to.

### Example: Integrating with Clerk

[`@clerk/nextjs`](https://clerk.com/docs/references/nextjs/overview) provides a middleware that can be [combined](https://clerk.com/docs/references/nextjs/clerk-middleware#combine-middleware) with other middlewares like the one provided by `next-intl`. By combining them, the middleware from `@clerk/next` will first ensure protected routes are handled appropriately. Subsequently, the middleware from `next-intl` will run, potentially redirecting or rewriting incoming requests.

```tsx filename="middleware.ts"
import {clerkMiddleware, createRouteMatcher} from '@clerk/nextjs/server';
import createMiddleware from 'next-intl/middleware';
import {routing} from './i18n/routing';

const handleI18nRouting = createMiddleware(routing);

const isProtectedRoute = createRouteMatcher(['/:locale/dashboard(.*)']);

export default clerkMiddleware((auth, req) => {
  if (isProtectedRoute(req)) auth().protect();

  return handleI18nRouting(req);
});

export const config = {
  // Match only internationalized pathnames
  matcher: ['/', '/(de|en)/:path*']
};
```

### Example: Integrating with Supabase Authentication

In order to use Supabase Authentication with `next-intl`, you need to combine the Supabase middleware with the one from `next-intl`.

You can do so by following the [setup guide from Supabase](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/server-side/nextjs?router=app) and adapting the middleware utils to accept a response object that's been created by the `next-intl` middleware instead of creating a new one:

```tsx filename="utils/supabase/middleware.ts"
import {createServerClient} from '@supabase/ssr';
import {NextResponse, type NextRequest} from 'next/server';

export async function updateSession(
  request: NextRequest,
  response: NextResponse
) {
  const supabase = createServerClient(
    process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!,
    process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY!,
    {
      cookies: {
        getAll() {
          return request.cookies.getAll();
        },
        setAll(cookiesToSet) {
          cookiesToSet.forEach(({name, value}) =>
            request.cookies.set(name, value)
          );
          cookiesToSet.forEach(({name, value, options}) =>
            response.cookies.set(name, value, options)
          );
        }
      }
    }
  );

  const {
    data: {user}
  } = await supabase.auth.getUser();

  return response;
}
```

Now, we can integrate the Supabase middleware with the one from `next-intl`:

```tsx filename="middleware.ts"
import createMiddleware from 'next-intl/middleware';
import {type NextRequest} from 'next/server';
import {routing} from './i18n/routing';
import {updateSession} from './utils/supabase/middleware';

const handleI18nRouting = createMiddleware(routing);

export async function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
  const response = handleI18nRouting(request);

  // A `response` can now be passed here
  return await updateSession(request, response);
}

export const config = {
  matcher: ['/', '/(de|en)/:path*']
};
```

(based on `@supabase/ssr@^0.5.0`)

### Example: Integrating with Auth.js (aka NextAuth.js) [#example-auth-js]

The Next.js middleware of [Auth.js](https://authjs.dev/) requires an integration with their control flow to be compatible with other middlewares. The [success callback](https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/nextjs#wrap-middleware) can be used to run the `next-intl` middleware on authorized pages. However, public pages need to be treated separately.

For pathnames specified in [the `pages` object](https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/nextjs#pages) (e.g. `signIn`), Auth.js will skip the entire middleware and not run the success callback. Therefore, we have to detect these pages before running the Auth.js middleware and only run the `next-intl` middleware in this case.

```tsx filename="middleware.ts"
import {withAuth} from 'next-auth/middleware';
import createMiddleware from 'next-intl/middleware';
import {NextRequest} from 'next/server';
import {routing} from './i18n/routing';

const publicPages = ['/', '/login'];

const handleI18nRouting = createMiddleware(routing);

const authMiddleware = withAuth(
  // Note that this callback is only invoked if
  // the `authorized` callback has returned `true`
  // and not for pages listed in `pages`.
  function onSuccess(req) {
    return handleI18nRouting(req);
  },
  {
    callbacks: {
      authorized: ({token}) => token != null
    },
    pages: {
      signIn: '/login'
    }
  }
);

export default function middleware(req: NextRequest) {
  const publicPathnameRegex = RegExp(
    `^(/(${locales.join('|')}))?(${publicPages
      .flatMap((p) => (p === '/' ? ['', '/'] : p))
      .join('|')})/?$`,
    'i'
  );
  const isPublicPage = publicPathnameRegex.test(req.nextUrl.pathname);

  if (isPublicPage) {
    return handleI18nRouting(req);
  } else {
    return (authMiddleware as any)(req);
  }
}

export const config = {
  matcher: ['/((?!api|_next|.*\\..*).*)']
};
```

## Usage without middleware (static export)

If you're using the [static export](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying/static-exports) feature from Next.js (`output: 'export'`), the middleware will not run. You can use [prefix-based routing](/docs/routing#locale-prefix) nontheless to internationalize your app, but a few tradeoffs apply.

**Static export limitations:**

1. Using a locale prefix is required (same as [`localePrefix: 'always'`](/docs/routing#locale-prefix-always))
2. The locale can't be negotiated on the server (same as [`localeDetection: false`](/docs/routing#locale-detection))
3. You can't use [pathname localization](/docs/routing#pathnames), as these require server-side rewrites
4. [Static rendering](/docs/getting-started/app-router/with-i18n-routing#static-rendering) is required

Additionally, other [limitations as documented by Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying/static-exports#unsupported-features) will apply too.

If you choose this approach, you might want to enable a redirect at the root of your app:

```tsx filename="app/page.tsx"
import {redirect} from 'next/navigation';

// Redirect the user to the default locale when `/` is requested
export default function RootPage() {
  redirect('/en');
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### "The middleware doesn't run for a particular page." [#middleware-not-running]

To resolve this, make sure that:

1. The [middleware](/docs/getting-started/app-router/with-i18n-routing#middleware) is set up in the correct file (e.g. `src/middleware.ts`).
2. Your middleware [matcher](#matcher-config) correctly matches all routes of your application, including dynamic segments with potentially unexpected characters like dots (e.g. `/users/jane.doe`).
3. In case you're [composing other middlewares](#composing-other-middlewares), ensure that the middleware is called correctly.
4. In case you require static rendering, make sure to follow the [static rendering guide](/docs/getting-started/app-router/with-i18n-routing#static-rendering) instead of relying on hacks like [`force-static`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/route-segment-config#dynamic).

### "My page content isn't localized despite the pathname containing a locale prefix." [#content-not-localized]

This is very likely the result of your [middleware not running](#middleware-not-running) on the request. As a result, a potential fallback from [`i18n/request.ts`](/docs/usage/configuration#i18n-request) might be applied.

### "Unable to find `next-intl` locale because the middleware didn't run on this request and no `locale` was returned in `getRequestConfig`." [#unable-to-find-locale]

If the middleware _is not_ expected to run on this request (e.g. because you're using a setup [without i18n routing](/docs/getting-started/app-router/without-i18n-routing)), you should explicitly return a `locale` from [`getRequestConfig`](/docs/usage/configuration#i18n-request) to recover from this error.

If the middleware _is_ expected to run, verify that your [middleware is set up correctly](#middleware-not-running).

Note that `next-intl` will invoke the `notFound()` function to abort the render if no locale is available after `getRequestConfig` has run. You should consider adding a [`not-found` page](/docs/environments/error-files#not-foundjs) due to this.
