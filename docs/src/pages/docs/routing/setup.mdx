In order to use unique pathnames for every language that your app supports, `next-intl` can be used to handle the following routing setups:

1. Prefix-based routing (e.g. `/en/about`)
2. Domain-based routing (e.g. `en.example.com/about`)

In either case, `next-intl` integrates with the App Router by using a top-level `[locale]` [dynamic segment](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes) that can be used to provide content in different languages.

## Initial setup

To get started with locale-based routing, we'll set up the following files:

<Steps>

### `src/i18n/routing.ts` [#i18n-routing]

We'll use `routing.ts` as a central place to define our routing configuration:

```ts filename="src/i18n/routing.ts"
import {defineRouting} from 'next-intl/routing';

export const routing = defineRouting({
  // A list of all locales that are supported
  locales: ['en', 'de'],

  // Used when no locale matches
  defaultLocale: 'en'
});
```

Depending on your requirements, you may wish to customize your routing configuration later—but let's finish with the setup first.

### `src/middleware.ts` [#middleware]

Once we have our routing configuration in place, we can use it to set up the middleware:

```tsx filename="src/middleware.ts"
import createMiddleware from 'next-intl/middleware';
import {routing} from './i18n/routing';

export default createMiddleware(routing);

export const config = {
  // Match all pathnames except for
  // - … if they start with `/api`, `/trpc`, `/_next` or `/_vercel`
  // - … the ones containing a dot (e.g. `favicon.ico`)
  matcher: '/((?!api|trpc|_next|_vercel|.*\\..*).*)'
};
```

<Details id="middleware-matcher-dots">
  <summary>How can I match pathnames that contain dots like `/users/jane.doe`?</summary>

If you have pathnames where dots are expected, you can match them with explicit entries:

```tsx filename="src/middleware.ts" {10,11}
// ...

export const config = {
  matcher: [
    // Match all pathnames except for
    // - … if they start with `/api`, `/trpc`, `/_next` or `/_vercel`
    // - … the ones containing a dot (e.g. `favicon.ico`)
    '/((?!api|trpc|_next|_vercel|.*\\..*).*)',

    // Match all pathnames within `{/:locale}/users`
    '/([\\w-]+)?/users/(.+)'
  ]
};
```

This will match e.g. `/users/jane.doe`, also optionally with a locale prefix.

</Details>

### `src/i18n/navigation.ts` [#i18n-navigation]

Additionally, we can use our routing configuration to set up the navigation APIs:

```ts filename="src/i18n/navigation.ts"
import {createNavigation} from 'next-intl/navigation';
import {routing} from './routing';

// Lightweight wrappers around Next.js' navigation
// APIs that consider the routing configuration
export const {Link, redirect, usePathname, useRouter, getPathname} =
  createNavigation(routing);
```

### `src/i18n/request.ts` [#i18n-request]

Now, we can read the matched locale in our request configuration:

```tsx filename="src/i18n/request.ts"
import {getRequestConfig} from 'next-intl/server';
import {hasLocale} from 'next-intl';
import {routing} from './routing';

export default getRequestConfig(async ({requestLocale}) => {
  // Typically corresponds to the `[locale]` segment
  const requested = await requestLocale;
  const locale = hasLocale(routing.locales, requested)
    ? requested
    : routing.defaultLocale;

  return {
    locale
    // ...
  };
});
```

### `src/app/[locale]/layout.tsx` [#layout]

To complete our setup, we'll move all of our existing layouts and pages into the `[locale]` segment:

```
src
└── app
    └── [locale]
        ├── layout.tsx
        ├── page.tsx
        └── ...
```

The `locale` that was matched is now available via the `[locale]` param:

```tsx filename="app/[locale]/layout.tsx"
import {NextIntlClientProvider, hasLocale} from 'next-intl';
import {notFound} from 'next/navigation';
import {routing} from '@/i18n/routing';

type Props = {
  children: React.ReactNode;
  params: Promise<{locale: string}>;
};

export default async function LocaleLayout({children, params}: Props) {
  // Ensure that the incoming `locale` is valid
  const {locale} = await params;
  if (!hasLocale(routing.locales, locale)) {
    notFound();
  }

  // ...
}
```

</Steps>

That's all it takes! From here, you can [configure your routing](/docs/routing/configuration) to cater to your specific needs.

In case you ran into an issue, have a look at the [App Router example](/examples#app-router) to explore a working app.

## Static rendering

When using locale-based routing, `next-intl` will currently opt into dynamic rendering when APIs like `useTranslations` are used in Server Components. This is a limitation that we aim to remove in the future, but as a stopgap solution, `next-intl` provides a temporary API that can be used to enable static rendering.

<Steps>

### Add `generateStaticParams`

Since we are using a dynamic route segment for the `[locale]` param, we need to use [`generateStaticParams`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-static-params) so that the routes can be rendered at build time.

Depending on your needs, you can add `generateStaticParams` either to a layout or pages:

1. **Layout**: Enables static rendering for all pages within this layout (e.g. `app/[locale]/layout.tsx`)
2. **Individual pages**: Enables static rendering for a specific page (e.g. `app/[locale]/page.tsx`)

**Example:**

```tsx
import {routing} from '@/i18n/routing';

export function generateStaticParams() {
  return routing.locales.map((locale) => ({locale}));
}
```

<Details id="generatestaticparams-locales">
<summary>Do I need to return all locales from `generateStaticParams`?</summary>

If you prefer to only render certain locales at build time, or none at all, you can be selective about the ones you return from `generateStaticParams` (see [Static Rendering](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-static-params#static-rendering) in the Next.js docs).

</Details>

### Add `setRequestLocale` to all relevant layouts and pages

`next-intl` provides an API that can be used to distribute the locale that is received via `params` in layouts and pages for usage in all Server Components that are rendered as part of the request.

```tsx filename="app/[locale]/layout.tsx"
import {setRequestLocale} from 'next-intl/server';
import {hasLocale} from 'next-intl';
import {notFound} from 'next/navigation';
import {routing} from '@/i18n/routing';

type Props = {
  children: React.ReactNode;
  params: Promise<{locale: string}>;
};

export default async function LocaleLayout({children, params}: Props) {
  const {locale} = await params;
  if (!hasLocale(routing.locales, locale)) {
    notFound();
  }

  // Enable static rendering
  setRequestLocale(locale);

  return (
    // ...
  );
}
```

```tsx filename="app/[locale]/page.tsx"
import {use} from 'react';
import {setRequestLocale} from 'next-intl/server';
import {useTranslations} from 'next-intl';

export default function IndexPage({params}) {
  const {locale} = use(params);

  // Enable static rendering
  setRequestLocale(locale);

  // Once the request locale is set, you
  // can call hooks from `next-intl`
  const t = useTranslations('IndexPage');

  return (
    // ...
  );
}
```

**Keep in mind that:**

1. The locale that you pass to `setRequestLocale` should be validated (e.g. in your [root layout](#layout)).
2. You need to call this function in every page and every layout that you intend to enable static rendering for since Next.js can render layouts and pages independently.
3. `setRequestLocale` needs to be called before you invoke any functions from `next-intl` like `useTranslations` or `getMessages`.

<Details id="setrequestlocale-implementation">
<summary>How does setRequestLocale work?</summary>

`next-intl` uses [`cache()`](https://react.dev/reference/react/cache) to create a mutable store that holds the current locale. By calling `setRequestLocale`, the current locale will be written to the store, making it available to all APIs that require the locale.

Note that the store is scoped to a request and therefore doesn't affect other requests that might be handled in parallel while a given request resolves asynchronously.

</Details>

<Details id="setrequestlocale-background">
<summary>Why is this API necessary?</summary>

Next.js currently doesn't provide an API to read route params like `locale` at arbitrary places in Server Components (see [`vercel/next.js`#58862](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/58862)). The `locale` is fundamental to all APIs provided by `next-intl`, therefore passing this as a prop throughout the tree doesn't stand out as particularly ergonomic.

Due to this, `next-intl` uses its middleware to attach an `x-next-intl-locale` header to the incoming request, holding the negotiated locale as a value. This technique allows the locale to be read at arbitrary places via `headers().get('x-next-intl-locale')`.

However, the usage of `headers` opts the route into dynamic rendering.

By using `setRequestLocale`, you can provide the locale that is received in layouts and pages via `params` to `next-intl`. All APIs from `next-intl` can now read from this value instead of the header, enabling static rendering.

</Details>

### Use the `locale` param in metadata

In addition to the rendering of your pages, also page metadata needs to qualify for static rendering.

To achieve this, you can forward the `locale` that you receive from Next.js via `params` to the [awaitable functions from `next-intl`](/docs/environments/server-client-components#async-components).

```tsx filename="page.tsx"
import {getTranslations} from 'next-intl/server';

export async function generateMetadata({params}) {
  const {locale} = await params;
  const t = await getTranslations({locale, namespace: 'Metadata'});

  return {
    title: t('title')
  };
}
```

</Steps>
