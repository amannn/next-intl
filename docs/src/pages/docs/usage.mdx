# Usage guide

This guide explains how `next-intl` can be used in React components.

Note that while it might be helpful to get an overview of the capabilities of `next-intl`, you don't have to read the whole usage guide upfront. Rather, you can come back to it as necessary.

Let's get started:

<Cards className="mt-8 lg:w-1/2">
  <Card
    title="Render translations in components"
    href="/docs/usage/translations"
  />
</Cards>
