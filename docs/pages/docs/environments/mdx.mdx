# Markdown (MDX)

Especially for sites where the content varies significantly by locale and may require a different structure, it can be helpful to use Markdown or [MDX](https://mdxjs.com) to provide your localized content. To consume this content in a Next.js app, you can use the [`@next/mdx`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/mdx) package, which allows you to import and render MDX content.

While you can create entire pages using `page.mdx` files, in an app that uses [the `[locale]` segment](/docs/getting-started/app-router), it can be beneficial to import localized MDX content based on the user's locale into a single `page.tsx` file.

After following the [setup instructions for `@next/mdx`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/mdx), you can consider placing your localized MDX files next to a page that will render them:

```
src
└── app
    └── [locale]
        ├── page.tsx
        ├── en.mdx
        └── de.mdx
```

Now, in `page.tsx`, you can import the MDX content based on the user's locale:

```tsx filename="src/app/[locale]/page.tsx"
export default async function HomePage({params}) {
  const Content = (await import(`./${params.locale}.mdx`)).default;
  return <Content />;
}
```

In this example, an MDX file might look like this:

```mdx filename="src/app/[locale]/en.mdx"
import Portrait from '@/components/Portrait';

# Home

Welcome to my site!

<Portrait />
```

Components that invoke hooks from `next-intl` like `useTranslations` can naturally be used in MDX content and will respect the user's locale.

<Details id="rich-text">
<summary>Is MDX required to format rich text?</summary>

Not at all! Messages support [rich text syntax](/docs/usage/messages#rich-text), which can be used to provide formatting, structure and embedding of components.

<Details id="remote-files">
<summary>Can I load MDX content from a remote source?</summary>

Especially if you'd like to allow translators to collaborate on MDX files, you can consider uploading them to a translation management system like <PartnerContentLink href="https://crowdin.com/">Crowdin</PartnerContentLink>.

In this case, you can fetch the MDX content dynamically from within a page and parse it using a package like [`next-mdx-remote`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/mdx#remote-mdx).

Note that MDX compiles to JavaScript and is dynamically evaluated. You should be sure to only load MDX content from a trusted source, otherwise this can lead to [arbitrary code execution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrary_code_execution).
