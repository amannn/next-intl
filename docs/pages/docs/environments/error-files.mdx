# Internationalization in Next.js error files

The Next.js App Router's file convention provides two files that can be used for error handling:

1. [`not-found.js`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/not-found)
2. [`error.js`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/error)

This page provides practical guides for these cases.

<Callout>
  Have a look at [the App Router example](/examples/app-router) to explore a
  working app with error handling.
</Callout>

## `not-found.js`

Next.js renders the closest `not-found` page when a route segment calls the [`notFound` function](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/not-found). Since the `[locale]` segment is used to localize your app, the `not-found` page needs to be located within this route segment too.

```tsx filename="app/[locale]/not-found.tsx"
import {useTranslations} from 'next-intl';
import PageLayout from 'components/PageLayout';

export default function NotFoundPage() {
  const t = useTranslations('NotFoundPage');
  return <h1>{t('title')}</h1>;
}
```

Note however, that Next.js will only render this page when the `notFound` function is called from within a route, not for all unknown routes in general.

### Catching unknown routes

To catch unknown routes too, you can define a catch-all route that explicitly calls the `notFound` function.

```tsx filename="app/[locale]/[...rest]/page.tsx"
import {notFound} from 'next/navigation';

export default function CatchAllPage() {
  notFound();
}
```

After this change, all requests that are matched within the `[locale]` segment will render the `not-found` page when an unknown route is encountered.

### Catching non-localized requests

When the user requests a route that is not matched by [the `next-intl` middleware](/docs/routing/middleware) (depending on your `matcher` config), there's no locale associated with the request (e.g. `/unknown.txt`). You can add a root `not-found` page to handle these cases too.

```tsx filename="app/not-found.tsx"
'use client';

import Error from 'next/error';

// Render the default Next.js 404 page when a route
// is requested that doesn't match the middleware and
// therefore doesn't have a locale associated with it.

export default function NotFound() {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>
        <Error statusCode={404} />
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

Note that a root layout file is required in this case, even if [it's just passing `children` through](https://github.com/amannn/next-intl/blob/main/examples/example-next-13/src/app/layout.tsx).

## `error.js`

When an `error` file is defined, Next.js creates [an error boundary within your layout](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/error-handling#how-errorjs-works) that wraps pages accordingly to catch runtime errors:

<figure>
<div className="w-full lg:w-[500px]">
```tsx
<LocaleLayout>
  <ErrorBoundary fallback={<Error />}>
    <Page />
  </ErrorBoundary>
</LocaleLayout>
```
</div>

Since the `error` file must be defined as a Client Component, you have to use [`NextIntlClientProvider`](/docs/configuration#client-server-components) to provide messages in case the `error` file renders.

If you've [set up `next-intl` to be used in Client Components](http://localhost:3001/docs/getting-started/app-router-client-components), this is already the case and there's no additional setup needed. If you're using [the Server Components beta](/docs/getting-started/app-router-server-components) though, you have to provide the relevant messages in the wrapping layout.

<figure>

```tsx filename="app/[locale]/layout.tsx"
import pick from 'lodash/pick';

export default async function LocaleLayout({children}) {
  // ...
  const messages = useMessages();

  return (
    <html lang={locale}>
      <body>
        <NextIntlClientProvider
          locale={locale}
          messages={pick(messages, 'Error')}
        >
          {children}
        </NextIntlClientProvider>
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

<figcaption>
  Providing messages for the `error` file is only necessary when using [the
  Server Components beta](/docs/getting-started/app-router-server-components).
</figcaption>

</figure>

Once `NextIntlClientProvider` is in place, you can use functionality from `next-intl` in the `error` file:

```tsx filename="app/[locale]/error.tsx"
'use client';

import {useTranslations} from 'next-intl';

export default function Error({error, reset}) {
  const t = useTranslations('Error');

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{t('title')}</h1>
      <button onClick={reset}>{t('retry')}</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```
