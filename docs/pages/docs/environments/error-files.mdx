# Internationalization in Next.js error files

The Next.js App Router's file convention provides two files that can be used for error handling:

1. [`not-found.js`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/not-found)
2. [`error.js`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/error)

This page provides practical guides for these cases.

  working app with error handling.

## `not-found.js`

Next.js renders the closest `not-found` page when a route segment calls the [`notFound` function](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/not-found). We can use this mechanism to provide a localized 404 page by adding a `not-found` file within the `[locale]` folder.

```tsx filename="app/[locale]/not-found.tsx"
import {useTranslations} from 'next-intl';

export default function NotFoundPage() {
  const t = useTranslations('NotFoundPage');
  return <h1>{t('title')}</h1>;
}
```

Note however that Next.js will only render this page when the `notFound` function is called from within a route, not for all unknown routes in general.

### Catching unknown routes

To catch unknown routes too, you can define a catch-all route that explicitly calls the `notFound` function.

```tsx filename="app/[locale]/[...rest]/page.tsx"
import {notFound} from 'next/navigation';

export default function CatchAllPage() {
  notFound();
}
```

After this change, all requests that are matched within the `[locale]` segment will render the `not-found` page when an unknown route is encountered (e.g. `/en/unknown`).

### Catching non-localized requests

When the user requests a route that is not matched by [the `next-intl` middleware](/docs/routing/middleware), there's no locale associated with the request (depending on your [`matcher` config](/docs/routing/middleware#matcher-config), e.g. `/unknown.txt` might not be matched).

You can add a root `not-found` page to handle these cases too.

```tsx filename="app/not-found.tsx"
'use client';

import Error from 'next/error';

export default function NotFound() {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>
        <Error statusCode={404} />
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

Note that the presence of `app/not-found.tsx` requires that a root layout is available, even if it's just passing `children` through.

```tsx filename="app/layout.tsx"
// Since we have a root `not-found.tsx` page, a layout file
// is required, even if it's just passing children through.
export default function RootLayout({children}) {
  return children;
}
```

For the 404 page to render, we need to call the `notFound` function in [`i18n.ts`](/docs/usage/configuration#i18nts) when we detect an incoming `locale` param that isn't a valid locale.

```tsx filename="i18n.ts"
import {notFound} from 'next/navigation';
import {getRequestConfig} from 'next-intl/server';

// Can be imported from a shared config
const locales = ['en', 'de'];

export default getRequestConfig(async ({locale}) => {
  // Validate that the incoming `locale` parameter is valid
  if (!locales.includes(locale as any)) notFound();

  return {
    // ...
  };
});
```

Note that `next-intl` will also call the `notFound` function internally when it tries to resolve a locale for component usage, but can not find one attached to the request (either from the middleware, or manually via [`unstable_setRequestLocale`](https://next-intl-docs.vercel.app/docs/getting-started/app-router#static-rendering)).

## `error.js`

When an `error` file is defined, Next.js creates [an error boundary within your layout](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/error-handling#how-errorjs-works) that wraps pages accordingly to catch runtime errors:

<figure>
<div className="w-full lg:w-[500px]">
```tsx
<LocaleLayout>
  <ErrorBoundary fallback={<Error />}>
    <Page />
  </ErrorBoundary>
</LocaleLayout>
```
</div>

Since the `error` file must be defined as a Client Component, you have to use [`NextIntlClientProvider`](/docs/usage/configuration#nextintlclientprovider) to provide messages in case the `error` file renders.

```tsx filename="app/[locale]/layout.tsx"
import pick from 'lodash/pick';
import {NextIntlClientProvider, useMessages} from "next-intl";

export default async function LocaleLayout({children}) {
  // ...
  const messages = useMessages();

  return (
    <html lang={locale}>
      <body>
        <NextIntlClientProvider
          locale={locale}
          messages={pick(messages, 'Error')}
        >
          {children}
        </NextIntlClientProvider>
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

Once `NextIntlClientProvider` is in place, you can use functionality from `next-intl` in the `error` file:

```tsx filename="app/[locale]/error.tsx"
'use client';

import {useTranslations} from 'next-intl';

export default function Error({error, reset}) {
  const t = useTranslations('Error');

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{t('title')}</h1>
      <button onClick={reset}>{t('retry')}</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Note that `error.tsx` is loaded right after your app has initialized. If your app is performance-senstive and you want to avoid loading translation functionality from `next-intl` as part of the initial bundle, you can export a lazy reference from your `error` file:

```tsx filename="app/[locale]/error.tsx"
'use client';

import {lazy} from 'react';

// Move error content to a separate chunk and load it only when needed
export default lazy(() => import('./Error'));
```
