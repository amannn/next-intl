# Internationalization in Next.js error files

The Next.js App Router's file convention provides two files that can be used for error handling:

1. [`not-found.js`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/not-found)
2. [`error.js`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/error)

This page provides practical guides for these cases.

## `not-found.js`

Next.js renders the closest `not-found` page when a route segment calls the [`notFound` function](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/not-found). We can use this mechanism to provide a localized 404 page by adding a `not-found` file within the `[locale]` folder.

```tsx filename="app/[locale]/not-found.tsx"
import {useTranslations} from 'next-intl';

export default function NotFoundPage() {
  const t = useTranslations('NotFoundPage');
  return <h1>{t('title')}</h1>;
}
```

Note however that Next.js will only render this page when the `notFound` function is called from within a route, not for all unknown routes in general.

### Catching unknown routes

To catch unknown routes too, you can define a catch-all route that explicitly calls the `notFound` function.

```tsx filename="app/[locale]/[...rest]/page.tsx"
import {notFound} from 'next/navigation';

export default function CatchAllPage() {
  notFound();
}
```

After this change, all requests that are matched within the `[locale]` segment will render the `not-found` page when an unknown route is encountered.

### Catching non-localized requests

When the user requests a route that is not matched by [the `next-intl` middleware](/docs/routing/middleware), there's no locale associated with the request (depending on your `matcher` config, e.g. `/unknown.txt` might not be matched).

You can add a root `not-found` page to handle these cases too.

```tsx filename="app/not-found.tsx"
'use client';

import {redirect, usePathname} from 'next/navigation';

const defaultLocale = 'en';

export default function NotFound() {
  const pathname = usePathname();

  // Add a locale prefix to show a localized not found page
  redirect(`/${defaultLocale}${pathname}`);
}
```

Note that the presence of `app/not-found.tsx` requires that a root layout is available, even if it's just passing `children` through.

```tsx filename="app/layout.tsx"
// Since we have a root `not-found.tsx` page, a layout file
// is required, even if it's just passing children through.
export default function RootLayout({children}) {
  return children;
}
```

For the 404 page to render, we need to call the `notFound` function within `[locale]/layout.tsx` when we detect an incoming `locale` param that isn't a valid locale.

```tsx filename="app/[locale]/layout.tsx"
import {useLocale} from 'next-intl';
import {notFound} from 'next/navigation';

const locales = ['en', 'de'];

export default function LocaleLayout({children, params}) {
  // Validate that the incoming `locale` parameter is valid
  if (!locales.includes(locale as any)) notFound();

  return (
    <html lang={locale}>
      <body>{children}</body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

## `error.js`

When an `error` file is defined, Next.js creates [an error boundary within your layout](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/error-handling#how-errorjs-works) that wraps pages accordingly to catch runtime errors:

<figure>
<div className="w-full lg:w-[500px]">
```tsx
<LocaleLayout>
  <ErrorBoundary fallback={<Error />}>
    <Page />
  </ErrorBoundary>
</LocaleLayout>
```
</div>

Since the `error` file must be defined as a Client Component, you have to use [`NextIntlClientProvider`](/docs/usage/configuration#nextintlclientprovider) to provide messages in case the `error` file renders.

```tsx filename="app/[locale]/layout.tsx"
import pick from 'lodash/pick';

export default async function LocaleLayout({children}) {
  // ...
  const messages = useMessages();

  return (
    <html lang={locale}>
      <body>
        <NextIntlClientProvider
          locale={locale}
          messages={pick(messages, 'Error')}
        >
          {children}
        </NextIntlClientProvider>
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

Once `NextIntlClientProvider` is in place, you can use functionality from `next-intl` in the `error` file:

```tsx filename="app/[locale]/error.tsx"
'use client';

import {useTranslations} from 'next-intl';

export default function Error({error, reset}) {
  const t = useTranslations('Error');

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{t('title')}</h1>
      <button onClick={reset}>{t('retry')}</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Note that `NextIntlClientProvider` only provides the messages to your error page, but doesn't load any runtime code for processing translations on the client side. Only the error page will include this code, so the performance of other pages isn't affected.
