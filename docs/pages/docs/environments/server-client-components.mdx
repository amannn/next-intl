# Internationalization of Server & Client Components in Next.js 13

<Callout type="warning">

This page contains background information about the advantages of moving internationalization to Server Components. Note that this is currently only available in [the Server Components beta version](/docs/getting-started/app-router-server-components).

</Callout>

With the introduction of the App Router in Next.js 13, [React Server Components](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/react-essentials) became publicly available. This new paradigm allows components that don’t require React’s interactive features, such as `useState` and `useEffect`, to remain server-side only.

This applies to handling internationalization too.

```tsx filename="app/[locale]/page.tsx"
import {useTranslations} from 'next-intl';

// Since this component doesn't use any interactive features
// from React, it can be implemented as a Server Component.

export default function Index() {
  const t = useTranslations('Index');
  return <h1>{t('title')}</h1>;
}
```

## Benefits of handling i18n in Server Components [#server-components-benefits]

Moving internationalization to the server side unlocks new levels of performance, leaving the client side for interactive features.

<Callout emoji="✅" title="Benefits of server-side internationalization:">
  <ol className="ml-4 list-decimal">
    <li>
      Your messages never leave the server and don't need to be serialized for
      the client side
    </li>
    <li>
      Library code for internationalization doesn't need to be loaded on the
      client side
    </li>
    <li>No need to split your messages, e.g. based on routes or components</li>
    <li>No runtime cost on the client side</li>
    <li>
      No need to handle environment differences like different time zones on the
      server and client
    </li>
  </ol>
</Callout>

## Using internationalization in Client Components

Depending on your situation, you may need to handle internationalization in Client Components as well. There are several options for using translations or other functionality from `next-intl` in Client Components, listed here in order of recommendation.

### Option 1: Passing translations to Client Components

The preferred approach is to pass the processed labels as props or `children` from a Server Component.

```tsx filename="[locale]/faq/page.tsx" {7-9}
import {useTranslations} from 'next-intl';
import Expandable from './Expandable';

export default function FAQEntry() {
  const t = useTranslations('FAQEntry');
  return (
    <Expandable title={t('title')}>
      <FAQContent content={t('description')} />
    </Expandable>
  );
}
```

```tsx filename="Expandable.tsx" {5,14-15}
'use client';

import {useState} from 'react';

function Expandable({title, children}) {
  const [expanded, setExpanded] = useState(false);

  function onToggle() {
    setExpanded(!expanded);
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={onToggle}>{title}</button>
      {expanded && <div>{children}</div>}
    </div>
  );
}
```

As you see, we can use interactive features from React like `useState` on translated content, even though the translation only runs on the server side.

Learn more in the Next.js docs: [Nesting Server Components inside Client Components](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/react-essentials#nesting-server-components-inside-client-components)

### Option 2: Moving state to the server side

You might run into cases where you have dynamic state, such as pagination, that should be reflected in translated messages.

```tsx filename="Pagination.tsx"
function Pagination({curPage, totalPages}) {
  const t = useTranslations('Pagination');
  return <p>{t('info', {curPage, totalPages})}</p>;
}
```

You can still manage your translations on the server side by using:

1. [Page or search params](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/page)
2. [Cookies](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/cookies)
3. [Database state](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching)

In particular, page and search params are often a great option because they offer additional benefits such as preserving the state of the app when the URL is shared, as well as integration with the browser history.

<Callout>
  There's [an article on Smashing Magazine about using `next-intl` in Server
  Components](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2023/03/internationalization-nextjs-13-react-server-components)
  which explores the usage of search params through a real-world example
  (specifically [the section about adding
  interactivity](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2023/03/internationalization-nextjs-13-react-server-components/#adding-interactivity-dynamic-ordering-of-photos)).
</Callout>

### Option 3: Providing individual messages

If you need to incorporate dynamic state that can not be moved to the server side, you can wrap the respective components with `NextIntlClientProvider`.

```tsx filename="Counter.tsx"
import pick from 'lodash/pick';
import {useLocale, NextIntlClientProvider} from 'next-intl';
import ClientCounter from './ClientCounter';

export default function Counter() {
  const locale = useLocale();

  // Receive messages provided in `i18n.ts`
  const messages = useMessages();

  return (
    <NextIntlClientProvider
      locale={locale}
      messages={
        // Only provide the minimum of messages
        pick(messages, 'ClientCounter')
      }
    >
      <ClientCounter />
    </NextIntlClientProvider>
  );
}
```

([working example](https://github.com/amannn/next-intl/blob/feat/next-13-rsc/examples/example-next-13-advanced/src/components/client/02-MessagesOnClientCounter/Counter.tsx))

<Callout>
  `NextIntlClientProvider` doesn't automatically inherit configuration from
  `i18n.ts`, therefore make sure to provide all relevant props on the component.
  If you're configuring non-serializable values like functions, you have to mark
  the component that renders `NextIntlClientProvider` with `'use client'`
  ([example](https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/next-intl-non-serializable-props-on-nextintlclientprovider-r0h2hi?file=%2Fsrc%2Fapp%2F%5Blocale%5D%2FNextIntlProvider.tsx)).
</Callout>

### Option 4: Providing all messages

If you're building a highly dynamic app where most components use React's interactive features, you may prefer to make all messages available to Client Components.

```tsx filename="app/[locale]/layout.tsx" /NextIntlClientProvider/
import {NextIntlClientProvider} from 'next-intl';
import {notFound} from 'next/navigation';

export default async function LocaleLayout({children, params: {locale}}) {
  // Receive messages provided in `i18n.ts`
  const messages = useMessages();

  return (
    <html lang={locale}>
      <body>
        <NextIntlClientProvider locale={locale} messages={messages}>
          {children}
        </NextIntlClientProvider>
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

<Callout type="warning">
  Note that this is a tradeoff in regard to performance (see [the bullet points
  above](#server-components-benefits)).
</Callout>

## Troubleshooting

### "Failed to call `useTranslations`, because the context from `NextIntlClientProvider` was not found." [#missing-context]

You might encounter this error or a similar one referencing `useFormatter` while working on your app.

This can happen because:

1. The component that calls the hook accidentally ended up in a client-side module graph, but you expected it to render as a Server Component. If this is the case, try to [pass this component via `children`](#option-1-passing-translations-to-client-components) to the Client Component instead.
2. You're intentionally calling the hook from a Client Component, but `NextIntlClientProvider` is not present as an ancestor in the component tree. If this is the case, you can [wrap your component in `NextIntlClientProvider`](#option-3-providing-individual-messages) to resolve this error.
