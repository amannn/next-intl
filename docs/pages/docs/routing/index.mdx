# Next.js internationalized routing

When you provide content in multiple languages, you want to make your pages available under distinct pathnames (e.g. `/en/about`). `next-intl` provides the building blocks to set up internationalized routing as well as the navigation APIs to enable you to link between pages.

<Cards className="mt-8 lg:w-1/2">
  <Card arrow title="Routing middleware" href="/docs/routing/middleware" />
  <Card arrow title="Navigation APIs" href="/docs/routing/navigation" />
</Cards>

Note that these features are only relevant if you use the App Router. If you're using [`next-intl` with the Pages Router](/docs/getting-started/pages-router), you can use the [built-in capabilities from Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/internationalization).
