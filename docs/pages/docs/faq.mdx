# FAQ

## What trade-offs does this library make?

If you bundle `next-intl` for the client side ([which you don't have to](/docs/environments/server-client-components)), the bundle size comes in at ~14kB gzipped which is the tradeoff that's necessary for supporting all the included i18n features. There are smaller libraries for internationalization, but they typically cover less features.

If you don't need all features of `next-intl`, you can reduce the bundle size with tree shaking. Furthermore if [native `Intl.MessageFormat`](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-intl-messageformat) lands in JavaScript in the future, we might be able to reduce the bundle size significantly.

Generally, it's recommended to [handle internationalization in Server Components](/docs/environments/server-client-components) to avoid bundling `next-intl` for the client side in the first place.

## How is this library different from using react-intl?

1. This library offers tight integration with Next.js, e.g. through [the routing integration](/docs/routing) and Server Components support.
2. This library offers a hooks-only API for message consumption. The reason for this is that the same API can be used for attributes as well as `children`.
3. This library is built around the concept of namespaces and that components consume a single namespaceâ€”however this is not required.
4. This library currently doesn't support AST-based extraction like `react-intl`. Note that building ASTs for messages upfront can help with runtime performance, but in exchange your bundle size might grow.
5. This library is a bit smaller in size.
6. This library offers [type safety for message keys](/docs/workflows/typescript).

## Can `next-intl` be used with Jest and Storybook?

Yes. These environments pose the challenge that components render in isolation and therefore relevant providers might be missing. To fix this, you should wrap the component with `NextIntlClientProvider`.

Please see the [Jest example](https://github.com/amannn/next-intl/blob/main/examples/example-app-router/src/components/Navigation.spec.tsx) to explore a working setup. For Storybook, you have to [add a global decorator](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-stories/decorators#global-decorators) that configures the provider.

## Can `next-intl` be used without Next.js?

Yes, see [`use-intl`](https://github.com/amannn/next-intl/tree/main/packages/use-intl).

## Can `next-intl` be used with [Remix](https://remix.run/)?

Yes, see [the Remix example](https://github.com/amannn/next-intl/tree/main/examples/example-remix).

## Can `next-intl` be used with [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/)?

Yes, see [the React Native example](https://github.com/amannn/next-intl/tree/main/examples/example-react-native). Please double check that [the runtime requirements](/docs/environments/runtime-requirements) are fulfilled.
