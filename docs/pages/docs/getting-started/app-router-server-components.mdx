# Next.js 13: Internationalization (i18n) in Server Components

Next.js 13 introduces support for [React Server Components](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/react-essentials) with the App Router and unlocks [many benefits](/docs/environments/server-client-components) when handling internationalization entirely on the server side. `next-intl` is adopting the new capabilities and is currently offering a beta version to early adopters, who are already building apps using the `app` directory.

<Callout type="warning">
  Support for React Server Components is currently in beta. Please use it at
  your own risk, knowing that you may have to migrate upon a stable release.
</Callout>

## Current beta version

```
npm install next-intl@3.0.0-beta.6
```

This beta version was tested with `next@13.4.0`.

## Roadmap

| Feature                                            | Status |
| :------------------------------------------------- | :----: |
| Usage of all `next-intl` APIs in Server Components |   ✅   |
| Dynamic rendering                                  |   ✅   |
| Static rendering (i.e. `generateStaticParams`)     |   🏗️   |

<Callout emoji="🏗️">
  Full support for static rendering is currently pending, but [stopgap solutions
  are available](#static-rendering).
</Callout>

For details, see the [pending pull request for Server Components support](https://github.com/amannn/next-intl/pull/149).

## Getting started

If you haven't done so already, [create a Next.js 13 app that uses the App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/installation). All pages should be moved within a `[locale]` folder so that we can use this segment to provide content in different languages (e.g. `/en`, `/en/about`, etc.).

**Start by running `npm install next-intl` and create the following file structure:**

```
├── messages (1)
│   ├── en.json
│   └── ...
├── i18n.ts (2)
├── next.config.js (3)
├── middleware.ts (4)
└── app
    └── [locale]
        ├── layout.tsx (5)
        └── page.tsx (6)
```

**Now, set up the files as follows:**

<Steps>

### `messages/en.json`

Messages can be provided locally or loaded from a remote data source (e.g. a translation management system). Use whatever suits your workflow best.

The simplest option is to create JSON files locally based on locales, e.g. `en.json`.

```json filename="messages/en.json"
{
  "Index": {
    "title": "Hello world!"
  }
}
```

### `i18n.ts`

`next-intl` creates a configuration once per request and makes it available to all Server Components. Here you can provide messages and other options depending the locale of the user.

```tsx filename="i18n.ts"
import {getRequestConfig} from 'next-intl/server';

export default getRequestConfig(async ({locale}) => ({
  messages: (await import(`./messages/${locale}.json`)).default
}));
```

### `next.config.js`

Now, set up the plugin and provide the path to your configuration.

```js filename="next.config.js"
const withNextIntl = require('next-intl/plugin')(
  // This is the default (also the `src` folder is supported out of the box)
  './i18n.ts'
);

module.exports = withNextIntl({
  // Other Next.js configuration ...
});
```

### `middleware.ts`

[The middleware](/docs/routing/middleware) matches a locale for the request and handles redirects and rewrites accordingly.

```tsx filename="middleware.ts"
import createMiddleware from 'next-intl/middleware';

export default createMiddleware({
  // A list of all locales that are supported
  locales: ['en', 'de'],

  // If this locale is matched, pathnames work without a prefix (e.g. `/about`)
  defaultLocale: 'en'
});

export const config = {
  // Skip all paths that should not be internationalized. This example skips the
  // folders "api", "_next" and all files with an extension (e.g. favicon.ico)
  matcher: ['/((?!api|_next|.*\\..*).*)']
};
```

### `app/[locale]/layout.tsx`

The `locale` that was matched by the middleware is available via `useLocale` and can be used to configure the document language.

```tsx filename="app/[locale]/layout.tsx"
import {useLocale} from 'next-intl';
import {notFound} from 'next/navigation';

export default function LocaleLayout({children, params}) {
  const locale = useLocale();

  // Show a 404 error if the user requests an unknown locale
  if (params.locale !== locale) {
    notFound();
  }

  return (
    <html lang={locale}>
      <body>{children}</body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

### `app/[locale]/page.tsx`

Use translations in your page components or anywhere else!

```tsx filename="app/[locale]/page.tsx"
import {useTranslations} from 'next-intl';

export default function Index() {
  const t = useTranslations('Index');
  return <h1>{t('title')}</h1>;
}
```

</Steps>

That's all it takes! Now you can internationalize your apps on the server side.

## Static rendering

The support for using `next-intl` in React Server Components is currently limited to dynamic rendering and support for static rendering is pending until [`createServerContext`](https://react.dev/blog/2023/05/03/react-canaries#announcing-breaking-changes-and-new-features-early) is integrated with Next.js. If you have a strong need for static rendering, you can choose from a set of stopgap solutions depending on your needs.

**Temporary workarounds for static rendering:**

1. [Handle internationalization in Client Components](/docs/getting-started/app-router-client-components) for now, as static rendering is fully supported in this paradigm without limitations.

```tsx filename="app/[locale]/page.tsx"
'use client';

import {useTranslations} from 'next-intl';

export default function Index() {
  const t = useTranslations('Index');
  return <h1>{t('title')}</h1>;
}
```

2. The [APIs for using internationalization outside of components](#using-internationalization-outside-of-components) are integrated with static rendering. As a temporary solution, you can use these APIs in components too, but note that you have to "drill-down" the `locale` that is received via `params` to all components.

```tsx filename="app/[locale]/page.tsx"
import {getTranslator} from 'next-intl/server';

export default async function Index({params: {locale}}) {
  const t = await getTranslator(locale, 'Index');
  return <h1>{t('title')}</h1>;
}
```

3. Use [CDN caching](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfLFHp7Sbkg) to get the same performance characteristics from your dynamic pages as static ones. Note however that this is [not supported in Next.js itself](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/22319) (except for if you [apply a patch](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/22319#issuecomment-1565268095)), therefore this needs to be configured on your hosting solution (e.g. [Netlify](https://docs.netlify.com/routing/headers/#syntax-for-the-netlify-configuration-file), [Cloudflare](https://blog.cloudflare.com/transform-http-response-headers/)).

<Callout>
  Note that these are temporary workarounds that will no longer be necessary
  once `createServerContext` is integrated with Next.js. As soon as this is the
  case, there will be a stable release of `next-intl` with Server Components
  support.
</Callout>
