# Next.js 13: Internationalization (i18n) in Server Components

Next.js 13 introduces support for [React Server Components](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/react-essentials) with the App Router and unlocks [many benefits](/docs/environments/server-client-components) when handling internationalization entirely on the server side. `next-intl` is adopting the new capabilities and is currently offering a beta version to early adopters, who are already building apps using the `app` directory.

<Callout type="warning">
  Support for React Server Components is currently in beta. Please use it at
  your own risk, knowing that you may have to migrate upon a stable release.
</Callout>

## Current beta version

```
npm install next-intl@3.0.0-beta.16
```

This beta version was tested with `next@13.4.0`.

## Roadmap

| Feature                                            | Status |
| :------------------------------------------------- | :----: |
| Usage of all `next-intl` APIs in Server Components |   ✅   |
| Dynamic rendering                                  |   ✅   |
| Static rendering (i.e. `generateStaticParams`)     |   🏗️   |

<Callout emoji="🏗️">
  Full support for static rendering is currently pending, but [stopgap solutions
  are available](#static-rendering).
</Callout>

For details, see the [pending pull request for Server Components support](https://github.com/amannn/next-intl/pull/149).

## Getting started

If you haven't done so already, [create a Next.js 13 app that uses the App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/installation). All pages should be moved within a `[locale]` folder so that we can use this segment to provide content in different languages (e.g. `/en`, `/en/about`, etc.).

**Start by running `npm install next-intl` and create the following file structure:**

```
├── messages (1)
│   ├── en.json
│   └── ...
├── i18n.ts (2)
├── next.config.js (3)
├── middleware.ts (4)
└── app
    └── [locale]
        ├── layout.tsx (5)
        └── page.tsx (6)
```

**Now, set up the files as follows:**

<Steps>

### `messages/en.json`

Messages can be provided locally or loaded from a remote data source (e.g. a translation management system). Use whatever suits your workflow best.

The simplest option is to create JSON files locally based on locales, e.g. `en.json`.

```json filename="messages/en.json"
{
  "Index": {
    "title": "Hello world!"
  }
}
```

### `i18n.ts`

`next-intl` creates a configuration once per request and makes it available to all Server Components. Here you can provide messages and other options depending the locale of the user.

```tsx filename="i18n.ts"
import {getRequestConfig} from 'next-intl/server';

export default getRequestConfig(async ({locale}) => ({
  messages: (await import(`./messages/${locale}.json`)).default
}));
```

### `next.config.js`

Now, set up the plugin and provide the path to your configuration.

```js filename="next.config.js"
const withNextIntl = require('next-intl/plugin')(
  // This is the default (also the `src` folder is supported out of the box)
  './i18n.ts'
);

module.exports = withNextIntl({
  // Other Next.js configuration ...
});
```

### `middleware.ts`

[The middleware](/docs/routing/middleware) matches a locale for the request and handles redirects and rewrites accordingly.

```tsx filename="middleware.ts"
import createMiddleware from 'next-intl/middleware';

export default createMiddleware({
  // A list of all locales that are supported
  locales: ['en', 'de'],

  // If this locale is matched, pathnames work without a prefix (e.g. `/about`)
  defaultLocale: 'en'
});

export const config = {
  // Skip all paths that should not be internationalized. This example skips the
  // folders "api", "_next" and all files with an extension (e.g. favicon.ico)
  matcher: ['/((?!api|_next|.*\\..*).*)']
};
```

### `app/[locale]/layout.tsx`

The `locale` that was matched by the middleware is available via `useLocale` and can be used to configure the document language.

```tsx filename="app/[locale]/layout.tsx"
import {useLocale} from 'next-intl';
import {notFound} from 'next/navigation';

export default function LocaleLayout({children, params}) {
  const locale = useLocale();

  // Validate that the incoming `locale` parameter is a valid locale
  if (params.locale !== locale) {
    notFound();
  }

  return (
    <html lang={locale}>
      <body>{children}</body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

### `app/[locale]/page.tsx`

Use translations in your page components or anywhere else!

```tsx filename="app/[locale]/page.tsx"
import {useTranslations} from 'next-intl';

export default function Index() {
  const t = useTranslations('Index');
  return <h1>{t('title')}</h1>;
}
```

</Steps>

That's all it takes! Now you can internationalize your apps on the server side.

## Static rendering

The support for using `next-intl` in React Server Components currently opts your pages into dynamic rendering. This is a limitation that will eventually be lifted once [`createServerContext`](https://react.dev/blog/2023/05/03/react-canaries#announcing-breaking-changes-and-new-features-early) is available and integrated in Next.js.

If you have a strong need for static rendering, you can enable static rendering as follows:

<Steps>

### Add `generateStaticParams` to `app/[locale]/layout.tsx`

Since we use a dynamic route segment for the `[locale]` param, we need to provide all possible values via [`generateStaticParams`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-static-params) to Next.js, so the routes can be rendered at build time.

```tsx filename="app/[locale]/layout.tsx"
const locales = ['en', 'de'];

export function generateStaticParams() {
  return locales.map((locale) => ({locale}));
}
```

### Add `unstable_setRequestLocale` to all layouts and pages

As a stopgap solution, `next-intl` provides a temporary API that can be used to distribute the locale that is received via `params` in a layout or page for usage in all Server Components that are rendered as part of the request.

```tsx filename="app/[locale]/layout.tsx"
import {unstable_setRequestLocale} from 'next-intl/server';
import {locales} from '..';

export default async function LocaleLayout({
  children,
  params: {locale}
}) {
  // Show a 404 error if the user requests an unknown locale
  const isValidLocale = locales.some((cur) => cur === locale);
  if (!isValidLocale) notFound();

  unstable_setRequestLocale(locale);

  return (
    // ...
  );
}
```

```tsx filename="app/[locale]/page.tsx"
import {unstable_setRequestLocale} from 'next-intl/server';
import {locales} from '..';

export default async function IndexPage({
  params: {locale}
}) {
  // Show a 404 error if the user requests an unknown locale
  const isValidLocale = locales.some((cur) => cur === locale);
  if (!isValidLocale) notFound();

  unstable_setRequestLocale(locale);

  return (
    // ...
  );
}
```

**What does the "unstable" part mean?**

`unstable_setRequestLocale` is meant to be used as a stopgap solution and will eventually be replaced by an API that's based on `createServerContext`. When that time comes, you'll get a deprecation notice in a minor version and the API will be removed as part of a major version.

Note that Next.js can render layouts and pages indepently. This means that e.g. when you navigate from `/settings/profile` to `/settings/privacy`, the `/settings` segment might not re-render as part of the request. Due to this, it's important that `unstable_setRequestLocale` is called not only in the parent `settings/layout.tsx`, but also in the individual pages `profile/page.tsx` and `settings/page.tsx`.

Apart from that, the API can only be used for pages that receive `params` (i.e. not `not-found.tsx`).
