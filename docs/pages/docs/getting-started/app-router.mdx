# Next.js 13: Internationalization (i18n)

Next.js 13 introduces support for [React Server Components](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/react-essentials) with the App Router and unlocks [many benefits](/docs/environments/server-client-components) when handling internationalization on the server side.

## Getting started

If you haven't done so already, [create a Next.js 13 app that uses the App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/installation). All pages should be moved within a `[locale]` folder so that we can use this segment to provide content in different languages (e.g. `/en`, `/en/about`, etc.).

**Start by running `npm install next-intl` and create the following file structure:**

```
├── messages (1)
│   ├── en.json
│   └── ...
├── next.config.js (2)
└── src
    ├── i18n.ts (3)
    ├── middleware.ts (4)
    └── app
        └── [locale]
            ├── layout.tsx (5)
            └── page.tsx (6)
```

**Now, set up the files as follows:**

<Steps>

### `messages/en.json`

Messages can be provided locally or loaded from a remote data source (e.g. a translation management system). Use whatever suits your workflow best.

The simplest option is to create JSON files locally based on locales, e.g. `en.json`.

```json filename="messages/en.json"
{
  "Index": {
    "title": "Hello world!"
  }
}
```

### `next.config.js`

Now, set up the plugin which provides i18n configuration to Server Components.

```js filename="next.config.js"
const withNextIntl = require('next-intl/plugin')();

module.exports = withNextIntl({
  // Other Next.js configuration ...
});
```

### `src/i18n.ts`

`next-intl` creates a configuration once per request. Here you can provide messages and other options depending on the locale of the user.

```tsx filename="src/i18n.ts"
import {getRequestConfig} from 'next-intl/server';

export default getRequestConfig(async ({locale}) => ({
  messages: (await import(`../messages/${locale}.json`)).default
}));
```

<details>
  <summary>Can I move this file somewhere else?</summary>

This file is supported out-of-the-box both in the `src` folder as well as in the project root with the extensions `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.js` and `.jsx`.

If you prefer to move this file somewhere else, you can provide an optional path to the plugin:

```js filename="next.config.js"
const withNextIntl = require('next-intl/plugin')(
  // Specify a custom path here
  './somewhere/else/i18n.ts'
);

module.exports = withNextIntl({
  // Other Next.js configuration ...
});
```

</details>

### `middleware.ts`

[The middleware](/docs/routing/middleware) matches a locale for the request and handles redirects and rewrites accordingly.

```tsx filename="middleware.ts"
import createMiddleware from 'next-intl/middleware';

export default createMiddleware({
  // A list of all locales that are supported
  locales: ['en', 'de'],

  // Used when no locale matches
  defaultLocale: 'en'
});

export const config = {
  // Match only internationalized pathnames
  matcher: ['/', '/(de|en)/:path*']
};
```

### `app/[locale]/layout.tsx`

The `locale` that was matched by the middleware is available via the `locale` param and can be used to configure the document language.

```tsx filename="app/[locale]/layout.tsx"
import {useLocale} from 'next-intl';
import {notFound} from 'next/navigation';

const locales = ['en', 'de'];

export default function LocaleLayout({children, params: {locale}}) {
  // Validate that the incoming `locale` parameter is valid
  if (!locales.includes(locale as any)) notFound();

  return (
    <html lang={locale}>
      <body>{children}</body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

### `app/[locale]/page.tsx`

Use translations in your page components or anywhere else!

```tsx filename="app/[locale]/page.tsx"
import {useTranslations} from 'next-intl';

export default function Index() {
  const t = useTranslations('Index');
  return <h1>{t('title')}</h1>;
}
```

</Steps>

That's all it takes!

## Static rendering

The support for using `next-intl` in React Server Components currently opts your pages into dynamic rendering. This is a limitation that will eventually be lifted once [`createServerContext`](https://react.dev/blog/2023/05/03/react-canaries#announcing-breaking-changes-and-new-features-early) is available and integrated in Next.js.

If you have a need for static rendering in Server Components, you can enable it as follows:

<Steps>

### Add `generateStaticParams` to `app/[locale]/layout.tsx`

Since we use a dynamic route segment for the `[locale]` param, we need to provide all possible values via [`generateStaticParams`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-static-params) to Next.js, so the routes can be rendered at build time.

```tsx filename="app/[locale]/layout.tsx"
const locales = ['en', 'de'];

export function generateStaticParams() {
  return locales.map((locale) => ({locale}));
}
```

### Add `unstable_setRequestLocale` to all layouts and pages

As a stopgap solution, `next-intl` provides a temporary API that can be used to distribute the locale that is received via `params` in a layout or page for usage in all Server Components that are rendered as part of the request.

```tsx filename="app/[locale]/layout.tsx"
import {unstable_setRequestLocale} from 'next-intl/server';

const locales = ['en', 'de'];

export default async function LocaleLayout({
  children,
  params: {locale}
}) {
  // Validate that the incoming `locale` parameter is valid
  if (!locales.includes(locale as any)) notFound();

  unstable_setRequestLocale(locale);

  return (
    // ...
  );
}
```

```tsx filename="app/[locale]/page.tsx"
import {unstable_setRequestLocale} from 'next-intl/server';
import {locales} from '..';

export default async function IndexPage({
  params: {locale}
}) {
  unstable_setRequestLocale(locale);

  return (
    // ...
  );
}
```

**What does "unstable" mean?**

`unstable_setRequestLocale` is meant to be used as a stopgap solution and will eventually be replaced by an API that's based on [`createServerContext`](https://react.dev/blog/2023/05/03/react-canaries#announcing-breaking-changes-and-new-features-early). When that time comes, you'll get a deprecation notice in a minor version and the API will be removed as part of a major version.

Note that Next.js can render layouts and pages indepently. This means that e.g. when you navigate from `/settings/profile` to `/settings/privacy`, the `/settings` segment might not re-render as part of the request. Due to this, it's important that `unstable_setRequestLocale` is called not only in the parent `settings/layout.tsx`, but also in the individual pages `profile/page.tsx` and `settings/page.tsx`.

That being said, the API is expected to work reliably if you're cautious to apply it in all relevant places.
