# next-intl 3.0 release candidate

<small>Sep 22, 2023 Â· by Jan Amann</small>

Almost one year ago, on Oct 25, 2022, [Next.js 13 was announced](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-13) with beta support for the App Router and Server Components. Ever since then, `next-intl` began an exploration on what it means to provide an optimal experience for implementing i18n with these new capabilities.

Today, [after 320 commits and the involvement of over 50 community members](https://github.com/amannn/next-intl/pull/149), I'm absolutely thrilled to share the first release candidate of `next-intl` 3.0, which is now App Router-first.

If you're still happy with the Pages Router, rest assured that `next-intl` is dedicated to support this paradigm for as long as Next.js does. For those who already made the jump to the App Router, this means that `next-intl` now takes full advantage of the new capabilities.

## New features

1. [**Support for React Server Components**](/docs/environments/server-client-components): The APIs `useTranslations`, `useFormatter`, `useLocale`, `useNow` and `useTimeZone` can now be used in Server Components.
2. [**New async APIs to handle i18n outside of components**](/docs/environments/metadata-route-handlers): To handle i18n in the Metadata API and Route Handlers, the APIs `getTranslator`, `getFormatter`, `getNow`, and `getTimeZone` have been added.
3. [**Middleware for internationalized routing**](/docs/routing/middleware): While Next.js has built-in support for this with the Pages Router, the App Router doesn't include a built-in solution anymore. `next-intl` provides a drop-in solution that has you covered.
4. [**Internationalized navigation APIs**](/docs/routing/navigation): Similar to the middleware, this provides a drop-in solution that adds i18n support for Next.js' navigation APIs: `Link`, `useRouter`, `usePathname` and `redirect`.

The latter two have already been added in minor versions, but 3.0 cleans up the API and includes many improvements and fixes.

## Breaking changes

1. `next-intl` now requires two additional setup steps when you're using the App Router:
   1. [The `i18n.ts` module](/docs/getting-started/app-router-server-components#i18nts) provides configuration for Server Components
   2. [`next-intl/plugin`](/docs/getting-started/app-router-server-components#nextconfigjs) needs to be added to link your `i18n.ts` module to `next-intl`
2. `next-intl` now uses [`exports` in `package.json`](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#subpath-exports) to clearly define which modules are exported. This should not affect you, unless you've previously imported undocumented internals.
3. `NextIntlProvider` has been removed in favor of [`NextIntlClientProvider`](/docs/configuration#client-server-components)
4. `NextIntlClientProvider` now needs to be imported from `next-intl` instead of `next-intl/client`.
5. [The middleware](/docs/routing/middleware) now needs to be imported from `next-intl/middleware` instead of `next-intl/server`.
6. `next@^13.4` is now required for the RSC APIs. Next.js 12 is still supported for the Pages Router integration.
7. If you're using `NextIntlClientProvider` outside of the App Router (e.g. with the Pages Router), you need to define the `locale` prop explicitly.
8. `useIntl` has been replaced with [`useFormatter`](/docs/usage/dates-times).

If you've been part of the Server Components beta and have already tried out previous releases, first of all, thank you so much! Second: Some APIs saw iterations over the beta period, please upgrade to `next-intl@3.0.0-beta.19` and check if you see any deprecations in the console output of your app. If not, you should be able to upgrade to the release candidate without any changes.

## Upgrade now

We're still looking for more feedback, please try out the release candidate and [reach out](https://github.com/amannn/next-intl/pull/149) in case find something!

```
npm install next-intl@3.0.0-rc.1
