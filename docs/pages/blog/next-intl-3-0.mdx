# next-intl 3.0 release candidate

<small>Sep 28, 2023 · by Jan Amann</small>

Almost one year ago, on Oct 25, 2022, [Next.js 13 was announced](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-13) with beta support for the App Router and Server Components. Ever since then, `next-intl` began an exploration on what it means to provide an ideal experience for implementing i18n with the newly added capabilities.

Today, [after more than 300 commits and the involvement of over 50 community members](https://github.com/amannn/next-intl/pull/149), I'm absolutely thrilled to share **the first release candidate of `next-intl` 3.0**, which is now App Router-first.

If you're still happy with the Pages Router, rest assured that `next-intl` is dedicated to support this paradigm for as long as Next.js does. For those who have already migrated to the App Router, this means that `next-intl` now takes full advantage of the new capabilities.

## New features

1. **Support for React Server Components**: The APIs `useTranslations`, `useFormatter`, `useLocale`, `useNow` and `useTimeZone` can now be used in Server Components ([proposed docs](https://next-intl-docs-git-feat-next-13-rsc-next-intl.vercel.app/docs/environments/server-client-components)).
2. **New async APIs to handle i18n outside of components**: To handle i18n in the Metadata API and Route Handlers, the APIs `getTranslator`, `getFormatter`, `getNow`, and `getTimeZone` have been added ([proposed docs](https://next-intl-docs-git-feat-next-13-rsc-next-intl.vercel.app/docs/environments/metadata-route-handlers)).
3. **Middleware for internationalized routing**: While Next.js has built-in support for this with the Pages Router, the App Router doesn't include a built-in solution anymore. `next-intl` now provides a drop-in solution that has you covered ([proposed docs](https://next-intl-docs-git-feat-next-13-rsc-next-intl.vercel.app/docs/routing/middleware)).
4. **Internationalized navigation APIs**: Similar to the middleware, this provides a drop-in solution that adds internationalization support for Next.js' navigation APIs: `Link`, `useRouter`, `usePathname` and `redirect`. These APIs allow you to handle locale prefixes behind the scenes and also provide support for localizing pathnames (e.g. `/en/about` vs. `/de/ueber-uns`, see the [proposed docs](https://next-intl-docs-git-feat-next-13-rsc-next-intl.vercel.app/docs/routing/navigation)).

The latter two have already been added in minor versions, but 3.0 cleans up the API and includes many improvements and bug fixes.

## Breaking changes

If you've been part of the Server Components beta and have already tried out previous releases, first of all, thank you so much! Second: Some APIs saw iterations over the beta period, please carefully review the breaking changes below, even if you're already using some of the new APIs.

### Updated setup

`next-intl` now requires two additional setup steps when you're using the App Router:

1.  [The `i18n.ts` module](https://next-intl-docs-git-feat-next-13-rsc-next-intl.vercel.app/docs/getting-started/app-router-server-components#i18nts) provides configuration for Server Components
2.  [`next-intl/plugin`](https://next-intl-docs-git-feat-next-13-rsc-next-intl.vercel.app/docs/getting-started/app-router-server-components#nextconfigjs) needs to be added to link your `i18n.ts` module to `next-intl`

### New navigation APIs for the App Router

With [v2.14](https://github.com/amannn/next-intl/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#2140-2023-05-10), the navigation APIs `useRouter`, `usePathname` and `Link` were added to `next-intl` that enabled you to use the APIs you're used to from Next.js while automatically considering a `locale` behind the scenes.

With 3.0, we're cleaning up these APIs by moving them to a shared namespace as well as introducing type-safety for the `locale` prop that can be passed to these APIs.

```diff
- import Link from 'next-intl/link';
- import {useRouter, usePathname} from 'next-intl/client';
- import {redirect} from 'next-intl/server';

+ import {createSharedPathnamesNavigation} from 'next-intl/navigation';
+
+ const locales = ['en', 'de'] as const;
+ const {Link, useRouter, usePathname, redirect} = createSharedPathnamesNavigation({locales});
```

Typically, you'll want to call this factory function in a central place in your app where you can easily import from (see [the proposed navigation docs](https://next-intl-docs-git-feat-next-13-rsc-next-intl.vercel.app/docs/routing/navigation#shared-pathnames)).

These changes bring the existing APIs in line with the new [`createLocalizedPathnamesNavigation` API](https://next-intl-docs-git-feat-next-13-rsc-next-intl.vercel.app/docs/routing/navigation#localized-pathnames) that allows you to localize pathnames:

```tsx filename="navigation.ts"
import {createLocalizedPathnamesNavigation, Pathnames} from 'next-intl/navigation';

export const locales = ['en', 'de'] as const;

// The `pathnames` object holds pairs of internal
// and external paths, separated by locale.
export const pathnames = {
  // If all locales use the same pathname, a
  // single external path can be provided.
  '/': '/',
  '/blog': '/blog',

  // If locales use different paths, you can
  // specify each external path per locale.
  '/about': {
    en: '/about',
    de: '/ueber-uns'
  }
} satisfies Pathnames<typeof locales>;

export const {Link, redirect, usePathname, useRouter} =
  createLocalizedPathnamesNavigation({locales, pathnames});
```

By using a similar API, you can upgrade from shared pathnames to localized pathnames by replacing the factory function.

### Switching the middleware default of `localePrefix` to `always`

Previously, the [`localePrefix` of the middleware](https://next-intl-docs-git-feat-next-13-rsc-next-intl.vercel.app/docs/routing/middleware#locale-prefix) defaulted to `as-needed`, meaning that a locale prefix was only added for non-default locales.

This default has now been changed to `always` since this has two advantages:

1. We can recommend [a safer default `matcher`](https://next-intl-docs-git-feat-next-13-rsc-next-intl.vercel.app/docs/routing/middleware#matcher-config) that needs no extra treatment for pathnames with dots (e.g. `/users/jane.doe`)
2. It avoids an [edge case of `Link`](https://next-intl-docs-git-feat-next-13-rsc-next-intl.vercel.app/docs/routing/middleware#locale-prefix-as-needed) where we include a prefix for the default locale on the server side but patch this on the client side by removing the prefix (certain SEO tools might report a hint that a link points to a redirect in this case).

If you want to stay on the `as-needed` strategy, you can [configure this option](https://next-intl-docs-git-feat-next-13-rsc-next-intl.vercel.app/docs/routing/middleware#locale-prefix-as-needed) in the middleware.

### Static rendering of Server Components

With the newly introduced Server Components support comes a temporary workaround for static rendering.

If you call APIs like `useTranslations` in a Server Component, by default, the hook will opt the page into dynamic rendering. This is a limitation that we aim to remove in the future, but as a stopgap solution, we've added the [`unstable_setRequestLocale`](https://next-intl-docs-git-feat-next-13-rsc-next-intl.vercel.app/docs/getting-started/app-router-server-components#static-rendering) API so that you can keep your pages fully static.

Note that if you're using `next-intl` exclusively in Client Components, this doesn't apply to your app and static rendering will continue to work as it did before.

### Other notable changes

1. `next-intl` now uses [`exports` in `package.json`](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#subpath-exports) to clearly define which modules are exported. This should not affect you, unless you've previously imported undocumented internals.
2. `NextIntlProvider` has been removed in favor of [`NextIntlClientProvider`](https://next-intl-docs-git-feat-next-13-rsc-next-intl.vercel.app/docs/configuration#client-server-components)
3. `NextIntlClientProvider` now needs to be imported from `next-intl` instead of `next-intl/client`.
4. [The middleware](https://next-intl-docs-git-feat-next-13-rsc-next-intl.vercel.app/docs/routing/middleware) now needs to be imported from `next-intl/middleware` instead of `next-intl/server` (deprecated since v2.14).
5. `next@^13.4` is now required for the RSC APIs. Next.js 12 is still supported for the Pages Router integration.
6. If you're using `NextIntlClientProvider` outside of the App Router (e.g. with the Pages Router), you need to define the `locale` prop explicitly.
7. `useMessages` now has a non-nullable return type for easier consumption and will throw if no messages are configured.
8. `createTranslator(…).rich` now returns a `ReactNode`. Previously, this was somewhat confusing, since `t.rich` accepted and returned either React elements or strings depending on if you retrieve the fuction via `useTranslations` or `createTranslator`. Now, an explicit [`t.markup`](/docs/usage/messages#html-markup) function has been added to generate markup strings like `'<b>Hello</b>'` outside of React components.
9. `useIntl` has been replaced with [`useFormatter`](https://next-intl-docs-git-feat-next-13-rsc-next-intl.vercel.app/docs/usage/dates-times) (deprecated since v2.11).
10. `createIntl` has been replaced with [`createFormatter`](https://next-intl-docs-git-feat-next-13-rsc-next-intl.vercel.app/docs/environments/core-library) (deprecated since v2.11).
