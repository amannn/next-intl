This library complements the [internationalized routing](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/i18n-routing) capabilities of Next.js by managing translations and providing them to components.

## Features

- üåü Messages use the **proven [ICU syntax](https://formatjs.io/docs/core-concepts/icu-syntax)** which covers interpolation, plurals, ordinal pluralization, label selection based on enums and rich text. I18n is an essential part of the user experience, therefore this library doesn't compromise on flexibility and never leaves you behind when you need to fine tune a translation.
- üìÖ Built-in **date, time and number formatting** provides all the necessary parts you need for localisation. You can use global formats for a consistent look & feel of your app and integrate them with translations.
- üí° A **hooks-only API** ensures that you can use the same API for `children` as well as for attributes which expect strings.
- ‚öîÔ∏è Based on **battle-tested** building blocks from [Format.JS](https://formatjs.io/) (used by `react-intl`) and modern browser APIs, this library is a thin wrapper around high-quality, lower-level APIs for i18n.
- üöÄ By integrating with both **static as well as server side rendering** you always get the best possible performance from your app.

## What does it look like?

This library is based on the premise that messages can be grouped by namespaces (typically a component name).

```js
// en.json
{
  "LatestFollower": {
    "latestFollower": "{username} started following you",
    "followBack": "Follow back"
  }
}
```

```jsx
// LatestFollower.js
function LatestFollower({user}) {
  const t = useTranslations('LatestFollower');

  return (
    <>
      <Text>{t('latestFollower', {username: user.name})}</Text>
      <IconButton aria-label={t('followBack')} icon={<FollowIcon />} />
    </>
  );
}
```
