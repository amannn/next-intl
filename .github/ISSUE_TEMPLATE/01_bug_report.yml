        Thanks for taking the time to file a bug report!

        **Please note:**
        1. General usage questions are not bug reports. If you're looking for support with your app, you can consider asking for help on the [Next.js Discord](https://discord.com/invite/nextjs), [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask) or [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/amannn/next-intl/discussions) instead.
        2. `next-intl` is based on Next.js, therefore bugs in Next.js might cause errors in apps that use `next-intl`. Please make sure that the bug you're experiencing is _caused by_ by `next-intl`. If you're unsure, please search on [the Next.js issue tracker](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues) for similar issues.
        3. Bug reports without a reproduction may be closed immediately.
