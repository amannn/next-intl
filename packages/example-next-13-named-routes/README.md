# example-next-13-named-routes

An example that showcases how named routes can be used to localize pathname segments.

See:
 - `next.config.js`: Maps localized pathnames to internal paths.
 - `NamedLink.tsx`: Maps named routes to localized pathnames.

Note that currently `alternateLinks` is turned off, this needs to be customized.
