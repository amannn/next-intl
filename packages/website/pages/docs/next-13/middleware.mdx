# Middleware for i18n routing

The middleware handles redirects and rewrites based on the detected user locale.

```tsx filename="middleware.ts"
import createMiddleware from 'next-intl/middleware';

export default createMiddleware({
  // A list of all locales that are supported
  locales: ['en', 'de'],

  // If this locale is matched, pathnames work without a prefix (e.g. `/about`)
  defaultLocale: 'en'
});

export const config = {
  // Skip all paths that should not be internationalized
  matcher: ['/((?!api|_next|.*\\..*).*)']
};
```

There are two strategies for detecting the locale:

1.  [Prefix-based routing (default)](#prefix-based-routing-default)
2.  [Domain-based routing](#domain-based-routing)

Once a locale is detected, it will be saved in a cookie.

## Prefix-based routing (default)

Since your pages are nested within a `[locale]` folder, all routes are prefixed with one of your supported locales (e.g. `/de/about`). To keep the URL short, requests for the default locale are rewritten internally to work without a locale prefix.

**Request examples:**

- `/` → `/en`
- `/about` → `/en/about`
- `/de/about` → `/de/about`

### Locale detection

The locale is detected based on these priorities:

1. A locale prefix is present in the pathname (e.g. `/de/about`)
2. A cookie is present that contains a previously detected locale
3. The [`accept-language` header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept-Language) is matched against the available `locales`
4. The `defaultLocale` is used

To change the locale, users can visit a prefixed route. This will take precedence over a previously matched locale that is saved in a cookie or the `accept-language` header.

**Example workflow:**

1. A user requests `/` and based on the `accept-language` header, the `de` locale is matched.
2. The `de` locale is saved in a cookie and the user is redirected to `/de`.
3. The app renders `<Link locale="en" href="/">Switch to English</Link>` to allow the user to change the locale to `en`.
4. When the user clicks on the link, a request to `/en` is initiated.
5. The middleware will update the cookie value to `en` and subsequently redirects the user to `/`.

## Domain-based routing

If you want to serve your localized content based on different domains, you can provide a list of mappings between domains and locales to the middleware.

**Example:**

- `us.example.com` (default: `en`)
- `ca.example.com` (default: `en`)
- `ca.example.com/fr` (`fr`)

```tsx filename="middleware.ts"
import createMiddleware from 'next-intl/middleware';

export default createMiddleware({
  // All locales across all domains
  locales: ['en', 'fr'],

  // Used when no domain matches (e.g. on localhost)
  defaultLocale: 'en',

  domains: [
    {
      domain: 'us.example.com',
      defaultLocale: 'en',
      // Optionally restrict the locales managed by this domain. If this
      // domain receives requests for another locale (e.g. us.example.com/fr),
      // then the middleware will redirect to a domain that supports it.
      locales: ['en']
    },
    {
      domain: 'ca.example.com',
      defaultLocale: 'en'
      // If there are no `locales` specified on a domain,
      // all global locales will be supported here.
    }
  ]
});
```

The middleware rewrites the requests internally, so that requests for the `defaultLocale` on a given domain work without a locale prefix (e.g. `us.example.com/about` → `/en/about`). If you want to include a prefix for the default locale as well, you can add [`localePrefix: 'always'`](#always-use-a-locale-prefix).

### Locale detection

To match the request against the available domains, the host is read from the `x-forwarded-host` header, with a fallback to `host`.

The locale is detected based on these priorities:

1. A locale prefix is present in the pathname and the domain supports it (e.g. `ca.example.com/fr`)
2. If the host of the request is configured in `domains`, the `defaultLocale` of the domain is used
3. As a fallback, the [locale detection of prefix-based routing](#locale-detection) applies

<Callout>

Since unknown domains will be handled with [prefix-based routing](#prefix-based-routing-default), this strategy can be used for local development where the host is `localhost`.

</Callout>

Since the middleware is aware of all your domains, the domain will automatically be switched when the user requests to change the locale.

**Example workflow:**

1. The user requests `us.example.com` and based on the `defaultLocale` of this domain, the `en` locale is matched.
2. The app renders `<Link locale="fr" href="/">Switch to French</Link>` to allow the user to change the locale to `fr`.
3. When the link is clicked, a request to `us.example.com/fr` is initiated.
4. The middleware recognizes that the user wants to switch to another domain and responds with a redirect to `ca.example.com/fr`.

## Further configuration

### Always use a locale prefix

If you want to include a prefix for the default locale as well, you can configure the middleware accordingly.

```tsx filename="middleware.ts" {6}
import createMiddleware from 'next-intl/middleware';

export default createMiddleware({
  // ... other config

  localePrefix: 'always' // Defaults to 'as-needed'
});
```

In this case, requests without a prefix will be redirected accordingly (e.g. `/about` to `/en/about`).

Note that this will affect both prefix-based as well as domain-based routing.

### Disable automatic locale detection

If you want to rely entirely on the URL to resolve the locale, you can disable locale detection based on the `accept-language` header and a potentially existing cookie value from a previous visit.

```tsx filename="middleware.ts" {6}
import createMiddleware from 'next-intl/middleware';

export default createMiddleware({
  // ... other config

  localeDetection: false // Defaults to `true`
});
```

Note that in this case other detection mechanisms will remain in place regardless (e.g. based on a locale prefix in the pathname or a matched domain).

### Disable alternate links

The middleware automatically sets [the `link` header](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/specialty/international/localized-versions#http) to inform search engines that your content is available in different languages. Note that this automatically integrates with your routing strategy and will generate the correct links based on your configuration.

If you prefer to include these links yourself, you can opt-out of this behaviour.

```tsx filename="middleware.ts" {6}
import createMiddleware from 'next-intl/middleware';

export default createMiddleware({
  // ... other config

  alternateLinks: false // Defaults to `true`
});
```
