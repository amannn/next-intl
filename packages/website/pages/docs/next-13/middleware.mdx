# Next.js 13 middleware for i18n routing

The middleware handles redirects and rewrites based on the detected user locale.

```tsx filename="middleware.ts"
import createMiddleware from 'next-intl/middleware';

export default createMiddleware({
  // A list of all locales that are supported
  locales: ['en', 'de'],

  // If this locale is matched, pathnames work without a prefix (e.g. `/about`)
  defaultLocale: 'en'
});

export const config = {
  // Skip all paths that should not be internationalized
  matcher: ['/((?!api|_next|.*\\..*).*)']
};
```

## Strategies

There are two strategies for detecting the locale:

1.  [Prefix-based routing (default)](#prefix-based-routing-default)
2.  [Domain-based routing](#domain-based-routing)

Once a locale is detected, it will be saved in a cookie.

### Prefix-based routing (default)

Since your pages are nested within a `[locale]` folder, all routes are prefixed with one of your supported locales (e.g. `/de/about`). To keep the URL short, requests for the default locale are rewritten internally to work without a locale prefix.

**Request examples:**

- `/` → `/en`
- `/about` → `/en/about`
- `/de/about` → `/de/about`

#### Locale detection

The locale is detected based on these priorities:

1. A locale prefix is present in the pathname (e.g. `/de/about`)
2. A cookie is present that contains a previously detected locale
3. The [`accept-language` header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept-Language) is matched against the available `locales`
4. The `defaultLocale` is used

To change the locale, users can visit a prefixed route. This will take precedence over a previously matched locale that is saved in a cookie or the `accept-language` header.

**Example workflow:**

1. A user requests `/` and based on the `accept-language` header, the `de` locale is matched.
2. The `de` locale is saved in a cookie and the user is redirected to `/de`.
3. The app renders `<Link locale="en" href="/">Switch to English</Link>` to allow the user to change the locale to `en`.
4. When the user clicks on the link, a request to `/en` is initiated.
5. The middleware will update the cookie value to `en` and subsequently redirects the user to `/`.

### Domain-based routing

If you want to serve your localized content based on different domains, you can provide a list of mappings between domains and locales to the middleware.

**Example:**

- `us.example.com` (default: `en`)
- `ca.example.com` (default: `en`)
- `ca.example.com/fr` (`fr`)

```tsx filename="middleware.ts"
import createMiddleware from 'next-intl/middleware';

export default createMiddleware({
  // All locales across all domains
  locales: ['en', 'fr'],

  // Used when no domain matches (e.g. on localhost)
  defaultLocale: 'en',

  domains: [
    {
      domain: 'us.example.com',
      defaultLocale: 'en',
      // Optionally restrict the locales managed by this domain. If this
      // domain receives requests for another locale (e.g. us.example.com/fr),
      // then the middleware will redirect to a domain that supports it.
      locales: ['en']
    },
    {
      domain: 'ca.example.com',
      defaultLocale: 'en'
      // If there are no `locales` specified on a domain,
      // all global locales will be supported here.
    }
  ]
});
```

The middleware rewrites the requests internally, so that requests for the `defaultLocale` on a given domain work without a locale prefix (e.g. `us.example.com/about` → `/en/about`). If you want to include a prefix for the default locale as well, you can add [`localePrefix: 'always'`](#always-use-a-locale-prefix).

#### Locale detection

To match the request against the available domains, the host is read from the `x-forwarded-host` header, with a fallback to `host`.

The locale is detected based on these priorities:

1. A locale prefix is present in the pathname and the domain supports it (e.g. `ca.example.com/fr`)
2. If the host of the request is configured in `domains`, the `defaultLocale` of the domain is used
3. As a fallback, the [locale detection of prefix-based routing](#locale-detection) applies

<Callout>

Since unknown domains will be handled with [prefix-based routing](#prefix-based-routing-default), this strategy can be used for local development where the host is `localhost`.

</Callout>

Since the middleware is aware of all your domains, the domain will automatically be switched when the user requests to change the locale.

**Example workflow:**

1. The user requests `us.example.com` and based on the `defaultLocale` of this domain, the `en` locale is matched.
2. The app renders `<Link locale="fr" href="/">Switch to French</Link>` to allow the user to change the locale to `fr`.
3. When the link is clicked, a request to `us.example.com/fr` is initiated.
4. The middleware recognizes that the user wants to switch to another domain and responds with a redirect to `ca.example.com/fr`.

## Further configuration

### Always use a locale prefix

If you want to include a prefix for the default locale as well, you can configure the middleware accordingly.

```tsx filename="middleware.ts" {6}
import createMiddleware from 'next-intl/middleware';

export default createMiddleware({
  // ... other config

  localePrefix: 'always' // Defaults to 'as-needed'
});
```

In this case, requests without a prefix will be redirected accordingly (e.g. `/about` to `/en/about`).

Note that this will affect both prefix-based as well as domain-based routing.

### Disable automatic locale detection

If you want to rely entirely on the URL to resolve the locale, you can disable locale detection based on the `accept-language` header and a potentially existing cookie value from a previous visit.

```tsx filename="middleware.ts" {6}
import createMiddleware from 'next-intl/middleware';

export default createMiddleware({
  // ... other config

  localeDetection: false // Defaults to `true`
});
```

Note that in this case other detection mechanisms will remain in place regardless (e.g. based on a locale prefix in the pathname or a matched domain).

### Disable alternate links

The middleware automatically sets [the `link` header](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/specialty/international/localized-versions#http) to inform search engines that your content is available in different languages. Note that this automatically integrates with your routing strategy and will generate the correct links based on your configuration.

If you prefer to include these links yourself, e.g. because you're using [locale-specific rewrites](#localizing-pathnames), you can opt-out of this behavior.

```tsx filename="middleware.ts" {6}
import createMiddleware from 'next-intl/middleware';

export default createMiddleware({
  // ... other config

  alternateLinks: false // Defaults to `true`
});
```

## Localizing pathnames

If you want to localize the pathnames of your app, you can accomplish this by using appropriate [rewrites](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next.config.js/rewrites).

```js filename="next.config.js" {8-9}
const withNextIntl = require('next-intl/plugin')();

module.exports = withNextIntl({
  experimental: {appDir: true},
  rewrites() {
    return [
      {
        source: '/de/über',
        destination: '/de/about'
      }
    ];
  }
});
```

Since `next-intl` isn't aware of the rewrites you've configured, you likely want to make some adjustments:

1. Translate the pathnames you're passing to routing APIs like `Link` based on the `locale`. See the [named routes example](https://github.com/amannn/next-intl/blob/feat/next-13-rsc/packages/example-next-13-named-routes/) that uses the proposed [routing APIs from the Server Components beta](http://localhost:3000/docs/next-13/server-components#routing).
2. Turn off [the `alternateLinks` option](/docs/next-13/middleware#disable-alternate-links) and provide [search engine hints about localized versions of your content](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/specialty/international/localized-versions) by yourself.

## Composing other middlewares

By calling `createMiddleware`, you'll receive a function of the following type:

```tsx
middleware(request: NextRequest): NextResponse
```

If you need to incorporate additional behavior, you can either modify the request before the `next-intl` middleware receives it, or modify the response that is returned.

```tsx filename="middleware.ts"
import createIntlMiddleware from 'next-intl/middleware';
import {NextFetchEvent, NextMiddleware, NextRequest} from 'next/server';

export default async function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
  // Step 1: Use the incoming request
  const defaultLocale = request.headers.get('x-default-locale') || 'en';

  // Step 2: Create and call the next-intl middleware
  const handleI18nRouting = createIntlMiddleware({
    locales: ['en', 'de'],
    defaultLocale
  });
  const response = handleI18nRouting(request);

  // Step 3: Alter the response
  response.headers.set('x-default-locale', defaultLocale);

  return response;
}

export const config = {
  // Skip all paths that should not be internationalized
  matcher: ['/((?!_next|.*\\..*).*)']
};
```

### Example: Integrating with Auth.js (aka NextAuth.js) [#example-auth-js]

The Next.js middleware of [Auth.js](https://authjs.dev/) requires an integration into their control flow to be compatible with other middlewares. The [success callback](https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/nextjs#wrap-middleware) can be used to run the `next-intl` middleware on authorized pages. However, public pages need to be treated separately.

For pathnames specified in [the `pages` object](https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/nextjs#pages) (e.g. `signIn`), Auth.js will skip the entire middleware and not run the success callback. Therefore, we have to detect these pages before running the Auth.js middleware and run only the `next-intl` middleware in this case.

```tsx filename="middleware.ts"
import {withAuth} from 'next-auth/middleware';
import createIntlMiddleware from 'next-intl/middleware';
import {NextRequest} from 'next/server';

const locales = ['en', 'de'];
const publicPages = ['/', '/login'];

const intlMiddleware = createIntlMiddleware({
  locales,
  defaultLocale: 'en'
});

const authMiddleware = withAuth(
  // Note that this callback is only invoked if
  // the `authorized` callback has returned `true`
  // and not for pages listed in `pages`.
  function onSuccess(req) {
    return intlMiddleware(req);
  },
  {
    callbacks: {
      authorized: ({token}) => token != null
    },
    pages: {
      signIn: '/login'
    }
  }
);

export default function middleware(req: NextRequest) {
  const publicPathnameRegex = RegExp(
    `^(/(${locales.join('|')}))?(${publicPages.join('|')})?/?$`,
    'i'
  );
  const isPublicPage = publicPathnameRegex.test(req.nextUrl.pathname);

  if (isPublicPage) {
    return intlMiddleware(req);
  } else {
    return (authMiddleware as any)(req);
  }
}

export const config = {
  // Skip all paths that should not be internationalized
  matcher: ['/((?!api|_next|.*\\..*).*)']
};
```

There's a working [example that combines `next-intl` with Auth.js](https://github.com/amannn/next-intl/tree/main/packages/example-next-13-next-auth) on GitHub.
