# Core library

While `next-intl` is primarily intended to be used within React components, the core is agnostic and can be used independently of React.

```tsx
import {createTranslator} from 'next-intl';

const messages = {
  basic: 'Hello {name}!',
  rich: 'Hello <b>{name}</b>!'
};

// This creates the same function that is returned by `useTranslations`.
// Since there's no provider, you can pass all the properties you'd
// usually pass to the provider directly here.
const t = createTranslator({locale: 'en', messages});

// Result: "Hello world!"
t('basic', {name: 'world'});

// Rich text uses functions that accept and return a string.
// Result: "Hello <b>world</b>!"
t.rich('rich', {
  name: 'world',
  b: (chunks) => `<b>${chunks}</b>`
});
```

For date, time and number formatting, the `intl` object can be created outside of React as well:

```js
import {createFormatter} from 'next-intl';

// Creates the same object that is returned by `useFormatter`.
const format = createFormatter({locale: 'en'});

// Result: "Oct 17, 2022"
format.dateTime(new Date(2022, 9, 17), {dateStyle: 'medium'});
```

A common example for the usage of the core library is to use messages in [Next.js API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction). See the [advanced example](/examples/advanced) for a working implementation.
